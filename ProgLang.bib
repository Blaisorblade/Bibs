The type system can model the essential concepts of JAVA's inner classes as well as virtual types and family polymorphism found in BETA or GBETA. It can also model most concepts of SML-style module systems, including sharing constraints and higher-order functors, but excluding applicative functors. The type system can thus be used as a basis for unifying concepts that so far existed in parallel in advanced object systems and in module systems. The paper presents results on confluence of the calculus, soundness of the type system, and undecidability of type checking.},

	Abstract = {We study issues that arise in programming with primitive recursion over non-free datatypes such as lists, bags and sets. Programs written in this style can lack a meaning in the sense that their outputs may be sensitive to the choice of input expression. We are, thus, naturally lead to a set-theoretic denotational semantics with partial functions. We set up a logic for reasoning about the definedness of terms and a deterministic and terminating evaluator. The logic is shown to be sound in the model, and its recursion free fragment is shown to be complete for proving definedness of recursion free programs. The logic is then shown to be as strong as the evaluator, and this implies that the evaluator is compatible with the provable equivalence between different set (or bag, or list) expression . Oftentimes,the same non-free datatype may have different presentations, and it is not clear a priori whether programming and reasoning with the two presentations are equivalent. We formulate these questions, precisely, in the context of alternative presentations of the list, bag, and set datatypes and study some aspects of these questions. In particular, we establish back-and-forth translations between the two presentations, from which it follows that they are equally expressive, and prove results relating proofs of program properties, in the two presentations.},

Among other results, they show that these representations are interconvertible.
Given an algebra (i.e. fold) in union representation, one can build one in insert representation easily:
cons head tail = union (singleton head) tail
nil = empty
Given an algebra (i.e. fold) in insert representation, one can build one in union representation using the functional representation of difference lists, that is, by encoding lists as their prepend function of type [t] -> [t]
empty = id
singleton el = (tail -> cons el tail) = cons el
union x y = (tail -> (x . y) tail) = x . y.

nil is only used to reify difference lists to standard ones.

Meta-notes:
Grust cites this paper in his PhD thesis to show that it is hard to convert from insert queries (that is, folds) into union queries. The reason is that the translation they present is higher-order.},

@article{Harper93,
	Abstract = {The Edinburgh Logical Framework (LF) provides a means to define (or present) logics. It is based on a general treatment of syntax, rules, and proofs by means of a typed &lgr;-calculus with dependent types. Syntax is treated in a style similar to, but more general than, Martin-L{\"o}f's system of arities. The treatment of rules and proofs focuses on his notion of a judgment. Logics are represented in LF via a new principle, the judgments as types principle, whereby each judgment is identified with the type of its proofs. This allows for a smooth treatment of discharge and variable occurence conditions and leads to a uniform treatment of rules and proofs whereby rules are viewed as proofs of higher-order judgments and proof checking is reduced to type checking. The practical benefit of our treatment of formal systems is that logic-independent tools, such as proof editors and proof checkers, can be constructed.},

	Address = {New York, NY, USA},
	Annote = {This paper describes the Edinburgh Logical Framework, LF for short, which is the first part of the foundation of Twelf; this paper includes no logic programming elements.

LF includes a minimal dependent lambda-calculus, where types and values can abstract on values. Nothing can abstract on types; but everything of interest can be represented as values, including types of the embedded logic. By accepting these restrictions, various problems 

When needed, such one can abstract over such values to construct types, exactly like in a universe construction --- for instance obj : holtype -> Type in the encoding of higher-order logic. However, universe constructions need be used even in some cases which would usually be handled via polymorphism (again for higher-order logic, see HOAS abstraction and application for the embedded logic).

Moreover, it includes an approach for embedding logics which includes:

- Sorts of the metatheory of the logic (term, formula, individual, etc.) are represented as types in LF.
- Judgements of the represented theory are represented as types, while proofs are terms inhabiting those types, and proof rules are constructors of those terms. Proof checking reduces to type-checking.
- Martin-L{\"o}f's hypothetical and schematic/general judgements are encoded as types of functions producing judgements and taking, respectively, judgements or individuals.
- Binding is handled through higher-order abstract syntax (not cited by name in the paper, but used in all examples and emphasized as important). This way, the handling of binding is rather easy (as usual with HOAS).
- Derived rules can be proven easily, while proving admissibility is much harder.
- A definition of adequacy for encodings as a biijection which is compositional, that is commutes with substitution.

Many of these ideas are reflected in formalizations present in Harper's "Practical Foundations of Programming Languages".

According to the authors, the encoding is similar to AUTOMATH but separates better object and meta-level.

The writing style is precise but overall rather academic.},

@inproceedings{Nerella13,
	Abstract = {Object oriented programming languages raised the level of abstraction by supporting the explicit first class query constructs in the programming codes. The query constructs can be optimized by leveraging the techniques of query optimization from the domain of databases. The existing optimization approaches such as JQL, however, incur high run time overhead as optimizations are performed only at run time. Therefore, in this paper, we propose an approach that performs the query optimization at compile time utilizing the metadata annotations in the source code. The proposed approach first collects the data from the sample execution of the program and extracts the essential metadata for the string valued attributes. Then, the annotations consisting of the metadata values associated with string attributes are generated in the source code and the histograms are built using those annotations. The selectivity estimates of the predicates and the joins in the query are computed from the histograms. Next, the query plan is generated at compile time through the maximum selectivity heuristic. The query plan is modified at run time in cases of significant updates to the string data. The approach also incorporates the cache heuristics that determine whether to cache the query result or not. The cached query results are incrementally maintained up-to-date. Our experimental results demonstrate that our approach has reduced the run time of the program more than the earlier approaches such as JQL.},

@inproceedings{Parr11,
	Abstract = {Despite the power of Parser Expression Grammars (PEGs) and GLR, parsing is not a solved problem. Adding nondeterminism (parser speculation) to traditional LL and LR parsers can lead to unexpected parse-time behavior and introduces practical issues with error handling, single-step debugging, and side-effecting embedded grammar actions. This paper introduces the LL(*) parsing strategy and an associated grammar analysis algorithm that constructs LL(*) parsing decisions from ANTLR grammars. At parse-time, decisions gracefully throttle up from conventional fixed k>=1 lookahead to arbitrary lookahead and, finally, fail over to backtracking depending on the complexity of the parsing decision and the input symbols. LL(*) parsing strength reaches into the context-sensitive languages, in some cases beyond what GLR and PEGs can express. By statically removing as much speculation as possible, LL(*) provides the expressivity of PEGs while retaining LL's good error handling and unrestricted grammar actions. Widespread use of ANTLR (over 70,000 downloads/year) shows that it is effective for a wide variety of applications.},

	Abstract = {Domain-specific languages provide a promising path to automatically compile high-level code to parallel, heterogeneous, and distributed hardware. However, in practice high performance DSLs still require considerable software expertise to develop and force users into tool-chains that hinder prototyping and debugging. To address these problems, we present Forge, a new meta DSL for declaratively specifying high performance embedded DSLs. Forge provides DSL authors with high-level abstractions (e.g., data structures, parallel patterns, effects) for specifying their DSL in a way that permits high performance. From this high-level specification, Forge automatically generates both a na{\"\i}ve Scala library implementation of the DSL and a high performance version using the Delite DSL framework. Users of a Forge-generated DSL can prototype their application using the library version, and then switch to the Delite version to run on multicore CPUs, GPUs, and clusters without changing the application code. Forge-generated Delite DSLs perform within 2x of hand-optimized C++ and up to 40x better than Spark, an alternative high-level distributed programming environment. Compared to a manually implemented Delite DSL, Forge provides a factor of 3-6x reduction in lines of code and does not sacrifice any performance. Furthermore, Forge specifications can be generated from existing Scala libraries, are easy to maintain, shield DSL developers from changes in the Delite framework, and enable DSLs to be retargeted to other frameworks transparently.},

In this paper, we develop a dual approach for working with infinite data structures such as streams. Infinite data inhabits coinductive datatypes which denote greatest fixpoints. Unlike finite data which is defined by constructors we define infinite data by observations. Dual to pattern matching, a tool for analyzing finite data, we develop the concept of copattern matching, which allows us to synthesize infinite data. This leads to a symmetric language design where pattern matching on finite and infinite data can be mixed.

We present a core language for programming with infinite structures by observations together with its operational semantics based on (co)pattern matching and describe coverage of copatterns. Our language naturally supports both call-by-name and call-by-value interpretations and can be seamlessly integrated into existing languages like Haskell and ML. We prove type soundness for our language and sketch how copatterns open new directions for solving problems in the interaction of coinductive and dependent types.},

	Abstract = {In this paper, we study strong normalization of a core language based on System F-omega which supports programming with finite and infinite structures. Building on our prior work, finite data such as finite lists and trees are defined via constructors and manipulated via pattern matching, while infinite data such as streams and infinite trees is defined by observations and synthesized via copattern matching. In this work, we take a type-based approach to strong normalization by tracking size information about finite and infinite data in the type. This guarantees compositionality. More importantly, the duality of pattern and copatterns provide a unifying semantic concept which allows us for the first time to elegantly and uniformly support both well-founded induction and coinduction by mere rewriting. The strong normalization proof is structured around Girard's reducibility candidates. As such our system allows for non-determinism and does not rely on coverage. Since System F-omega is general enough that it can be the target of compilation for the Calculus of Constructions, this work is a significant step towards representing observation-centric infinite data in proof assistants such as Coq and Agda.},

	Abstract = {The paper studies connections between denotational and operational semantics for a simple programming language based on LCF. It begins with the connection between the behaviour of a program and its denotation. It turns out that a program denotes ⊥ in any of several possible semantics if it does not terminate. From this it follows that if two terms have the same denotation in one of these semantics, they have the same behaviour in all contexts. The converse fails for all the semantics. If, however, the language is extended to allow certain parallel facilities behavioural equivalence does coincide with denotational equivalence in one of the semantics considered, which may therefore be called ``fully abstract''. Next a connection is given which actually determines the semantics up to isomorphism from the behaviour alone. Conversely, by allowing further parallel facilities, every r.e. element of the fully abstract semantics becomes definable, thus characterising the programming language, up to interdefinability, from the set of r.e. elements of the domains of the semantics.},

	Abstract = {Functional-language compilers often perform optimizations based on beta and delta reduction. To avoid speculative optimizations that can blow up the code size, we might wish to use only shrinking reduction rules guaranteed to make the program smaller: these include dead-variable elimination, constant folding, and a restricted beta rule that inlines only functions that are called just once. The restricted beta rule leads to a shrinking rewrite system that has not previously been studied. We show some efficient normalization algorithms that are immediately useful in optimizing compilers; and we give a confluence proof for our system, showing that the choice of normalization algorithm does not affect final code quality.},

	Abstract = {Many online data sets evolve over time as new entries are slowly added and existing entries are deleted or modified. Taking advantage of this, systems for incremental bulk data processing, such as Google's Percolator, can achieve efficient updates. To achieve this efficiency, however, these systems lose compatibility with the simple programming models offered by non-incremental systems, e.g., MapReduce, and more importantly, requires the programmer to implement application-specific dynamic algorithms, ultimately increasing algorithm and code complexity.

In this paper, we describe the architecture, implementation, and evaluation of Incoop, a generic MapReduce framework for incremental computations. Incoop detects changes to the input and automatically updates the output by employing an efficient, fine-grained result reuse mechanism. To achieve efficiency without sacrificing transparency, we adopt recent advances in the area of programming languages to identify the shortcomings of task-level memoization approaches, and to address these shortcomings by using several novel techniques: a storage system, a contraction phase for Reduce tasks, and an affinity-based scheduling algorithm. We have implemented Incoop by extending the Hadoop framework, and evaluated it by considering several applications and case studies. Our results show significant performance improvements without changing a single line of application code.},

	Abstract = {Computing systems are becoming increasingly parallel and heterogeneous, and therefore new applications must be capable of exploiting parallelism in order to continue achieving high performance. However, targeting these emerging devices often requires using multiple disparate programming models and making decisions that can limit forward scalability. In previous work we proposed the use of domain-specific languages (DSLs) to provide high-level abstractions that enable transformations to high performance parallel code without degrading programmer productivity. In this paper we present a new end-to-end system for building, compiling, and executing DSL applications on parallel heterogeneous hardware, the Delite Compiler Framework and Runtime. The framework lifts embedded DSL applications to an intermediate representation (IR), performs generic, parallel, and domain-specific optimizations, and generates an execution graph that targets multiple heterogeneous hardware devices. Finally we present results comparing the performance of several machine learning applications written in OptiML, a DSL for machine learning that utilizes Delite, to C++ and MATLAB implementations. We find that the implicitly parallel OptiML applications achieve single-threaded performance comparable to C++ and outperform explicitly parallel MATLAB in nearly all cases.},

@article{LiuSkalka11staged,
	Annote = {Staging is a powerful language construct that allows a program at one stage of evaluation to manipulate and specialize a program to be executed at a later stage. We propose a new staged language calculus, 〈ML〉, which extends the programmability of staged languages in two directions. First, 〈ML〉 supports dynamic type specialization: types can be dynamically constructed, abstracted, and passed as arguments, while preserving decidable typechecking via a System F≤-style semantics combined with a restricted form of λ ω -style runtime type construction. With dynamic type specialization the data structure layout of a program can be optimized via staging. Second, 〈ML〉 works in a context where different stages of computation are executed in different process spaces, a property we term staged process separation. Programs at different stages can directly communicate program data in 〈ML〉 via a built-in serialization discipline. The language 〈ML〉 is endowed with a metatheory including type preservation, type safety, and decidability as demonstrated constructively by a sound type checking algorithm. While our language design is general, we are particularly interested in future applications of staging in resource-constrained and embedded systems: these systems have limited space for code and data, as well as limited CPU time, and specializing code for the particular deployment at hand can improve efficiency in all of these dimensions. The combination of dynamic type specialization and staging across processes greatly increases the utility of staged programming in these domains. We illustrate this via wireless sensor network programming examples.},

Traditional solutions based on event systems and the Observer pattern have a number of inconveniences, but programmers bear them in return for the benefits of OO design. On the other hand, reactive approaches based on automatic updates of dependencies - like functional reactive programming and dataflow languages - provide undoubted advantages but do not fit well with mutable objects. In this paper, we provide a research roadmap to overcome the limitations of the current approaches and to support reactive applications in the OO setting. To establish a solid background for our investigation, we propose a conceptual framework to model the design space of reactive applications and we study the flaws of the existing solutions.

	Abstract = {We present a game (or dialogue) semantics in the style of Lorenzen (1959) for Girard's linear logic (1987). Lorenzen suggested that the (constructive) meaning of a proposition ϕ should be specified by telling how to conduct a debate between a proponent P who asserts ϕ and an opponent O who denies ϕ. Thus propositions are interpreted as games, connectives (almost) as operations on games, and validity as existence of a winning strategy for P. (The qualifier `almost' will be discussed later when more details have been presented.) We propose that the connectives of linear logic can be naturally interpreted as the operations on games introduced for entirely different purposes by Blass (1972). We show that affine logic, i.e., linear logic plus the rule of weakening, is sound for this interpretation. We also obtain a completeness theorem for the additive fragment of affine logic, but we show that completeness fails for the multiplicative fragment. On the other hand, for the multiplicative fragment, we obtain a simple characterization of game-semantical validity in terms of classical tautologies. An analysis of the failure of completeness for the multiplicative fragment leads to the conclusion that the game interpretation of the connective ⊗ is weaker than the interpretation implicit in Girard's proof rules; we discuss the differences between the two interpretations and their relative advantages and disadvantages. Finally, we discuss how G{\"o}del's Dialectica interpretation (1958), which was connected to linear logic by de Paiva (1989), fits with game semantics. },

	Abstract = {Pattern matching makes ML programs more concise and readable, and these qualities are also sought in object-oriented settings. However, objects and classes come with open class hierarchies, extensibility requirements and the need for data abstraction, which all conflict with matching on concrete data types. Extractor-based pattern matching has been proposed to address this conflict. Extractors are user-defined methods that perform the task of value discrimination and deconstruction during pattern matching. In this paper, we give the first formalization of extractor-based matching, using a first-order object-oriented calculus. We give a direct operational semantics and prove it sound. We then present an optimizing translation to a target language without matching, and prove a correctness result stating that an expression is equivalent to its translation.},

CACHET is designed as a programming environment and implemented using a language-based editor generator, the Synthesizer Generator, with extensions that support complex transformations. Transformations directly manipulate the program tree and take into consideration information obtained from program analyses. Program analyses are performed via attribute evaluation, which is done incrementally as transformations change the program tree. The overall approach also explores a general framework for describing dynamic program semantics using annotations, which allows interleaving transformations with external input, such as user input. Designing CACHET as a programming environment also facilitates the integration of program derivation and validation with interactive editing, compiling, debugging, and execution},

	Abstract = {Dynamic programming is an important algorithm design technique. It is used for solving problems whose solutions involve recursively solving subproblems that share subsubproblems. While a straightforward recursive program solves common subsubproblems repeatedly and often takes exponential time, a dynamic programming algorithm solves every subsubproblem just once, saves the result, reuses it when the subsubproblem is encountered again, and takes polynomial time. This paper describes a systematic method for transforming programs written as straightforward recursions into programs that use dynamic programming. The method extends the original program to cache all possibly computed values, incrementalizes the extended program with respect to an input increment to use and maintain all cached results, prunes out cached results that are not used in the incremental computation, and uses the resulting incremental program to form an optimized new program. Incrementalization statically exploits semantics of both control structures and data structures and maintains as invariants equalities characterizing cached results. The principle underlying incrementalization is general for achieving drastic program speedups. Compared with previous methods that perform memoization or tabulation, the method based on incrementalization is more powerful and systematic. It has been implemented and applied to numerous problems and succeeded on all of them.},

	Abstract = {Incremental computation takes advantage of repeated computations on inputs that differ slightly from one another, computing each output efficiently by exploiting the previous output. This paper gives an overview of a general and systematic approach to incrementalization: given a program f and an operation ⊕, the approach yields an incremental program that computes f(x ⊕ y) efficiently by using the result of f(x), the intermediate results of f(x), and auxiliary information of f(x) that can be inexpensively maintained.
Since every non-trivial computation proceeds by iteration or recursion, the approach can be used for achieving efficient computation by computing each iteration incrementally using an appropriate incremental program. This approach has applications in interactive systems, optimizing compilers, transformational programming, and many other areas, where problems were previously solved in less general and systematic ways. This paper also describes the design and implementation of CACHET, a prototype system for incrementalization.},

@article{Acar09EAS,
	Abstract = {Recent work on adaptive functional programming (AFP) developed techniques for writing programs that can respond to modifications to their data by performing change propagation. To achieve this, executions of programs are represented with dynamic dependence graphs (DDGs) that record data dependences and control dependences in a way that a change-propagation algorithm can update the computation as if the program were from scratch, by re-executing only the parts of the computation affected by the changes. Since change-propagation only re-executes parts of the computation, it can respond to certain incremental modifications asymptotically faster than recomputing from scratch, potentially offering significant speedups. Such asymptotic speedups, however, are rare: for many computations and modifications, change propagation is no faster than recomputing from scratch.

In this article, we realize a duality between dynamic dependence graphs and memoization, and combine them to give a change-propagation algorithm that can dramatically increase computation reuse. The key idea is to use DDGs to identify and re-execute the parts of the computation that are affected by modifications, while using memoization to identify the parts of the computation that remain unaffected by the changes. We refer to this approach as self-adjusting computation. Since DDGs are imperative, but (traditional) memoization requires purely functional computation, reusing computation correctly via memoization becomes a challenge. We overcome this challenge with a technique for remembering and reusing not just the results of function calls (as in conventional memoization), but their executions represented with DDGs. We show that the proposed approach is realistic by describing a library for self-adjusting computation, presenting efficient algorithms for realizing the library, and describing and evaluating an implementation. Our experimental evaluation with a variety of applications, ranging from simple list primitives to more sophisticated computational geometry algorithms, shows that the approach is effective in practice: compared to recomputing from-scratch; self-adjusting programs respond to small modifications to their data orders of magnitude faster.},

	Abstract = {Self-adjusting computation provides an evaluation model where computations can respond automatically to modifications to their data by using a mechanism for propagating modifications through the computation. Current approaches to self-adjusting computation guarantee correctness by recording dependencies in a trace at the granularity of individual memory operations. Tracing at the granularity of memory operations, however, has some limitations: it can be asymptotically inefficient (\eg, compared to optimal solutions) because it cannot take advantage of problem-specific structure, it requires keeping a large computation trace (often proportional to the runtime of the program on the current input), and it introduces moderately large constant factors in practice.

In this paper, we extend dependence-tracing to work at the granularity of the query and update operations of arbitrary (abstract) data types, instead of just reads and writes on memory cells. This can significantly reduce the number of dependencies that need to be kept in the trace and followed during an update. We define an interface for supporting a traceable version of a data type, which reports the earliest query that depends on (is changed by) revising operations back in time, and implement several such structures, including priority queues, queues, dictionaries, and counters. We develop a semantics for tracing, extend an existing self-adjusting language, ΔML, and its implementation to support traceable data types, and present an experimental evaluation by considering a number of benchmarks. Our experiments show dramatic improvements on space and time, sometimes by as much as two orders of magnitude.},

	Abstract = {This paper presents a semantics of self-adjusting computation and proves that the semantics is correct and consistent. The semantics integrates change propagation with the classic idea of memoization to enable reuse of computations under mutation to memory. During evaluation, reuse of a computation via memoization triggers a change propagation that adjusts the reused computation to reflect the mutated memory. Since the semantics combines memoization and change-propagation, it involves both non-determinism and mutation. Our consistency theorem states that the non-determinism is not harmful: any two evaluations of the same program starting at the same state yield the same result. Our correctness theorem states that mutation is not harmful: self-adjusting programs are consistent with purely functional programming. We formalized the semantics and its meta-theory in the LF logical framework and machine-checked the proofs in Twelf.},

The library combines modifiable references and memoization to achieve efficient updates. We describe an implementation of the library and apply it to the problem of maintaining the convex hull of a dynamically changing set of points. Our experiments show that the overhead of the library is small, and that self-adjusting programs can adjust to small changes three-orders of magnitude faster than recomputing from scratch. The implementation relies on invariants that could be enforced by a modal type system. We show, using an existing language, abstract interfaces for modifiable references and for memoization that ensure the same safety properties without the use of modal types. The interface for memoization, however, does not scale well, suggesting a language-based approach to be preferable after all. },

	Abstract = {Many applications need to respond to incremental modifications to data. Being incremental, such modification often require incremental modifications to the output, making it possible to respond to them asymptotically faster than recomputing from scratch. In many cases, taking advantage of incrementality therefore dramatically improves performance, especially as the input size increases. As a frame of reference, note that in parallel computing speedups are bounded by the number of processors, often a (small) constant.

Designing and developing applications that respond to incremental modifications, however, is challenging: it often involves developing highly specific, complex algorithms. Self-adjusting computation offers a linguistic approach to this problem. In self-adjusting computation, programs respond automatically and efficiently to modifications to their data by tracking the dynamic data dependences of the computation and incrementally updating their output as needed. In this invited talk, I present an overview of self-adjusting computation and briefly discuss the progress in developing the approach and present some recent advances.},

@inproceedings{Acar08,
	Abstract = {Self-adjusting computation enables writing programs that can automatically and efficiently respond to changes to their data (e.g., inputs). The idea behind the approach is to store all data that can change over time in modifiable references and to let computations construct traces that can drive change propagation. After changes have occurred, change propagation updates the result of the computation by re-evaluating only those expressions that depend on the changed data. Previous approaches to self-adjusting computation require that modifiable references be written at most once during execution---this makes the model applicable only in a purely functional setting.

In this paper, we present techniques for imperative self-adjusting computation where modifiable references can be written multiple times. We define a language SAIL (Self-Adjusting Imperative Language) and prove consistency, i.e., that change propagation and from-scratch execution are observationally equivalent. Since SAIL programs are imperative, they can create cyclic data structures. To prove equivalence in the presence of cycles in the store, we formulate and use an untyped, step-indexed logical relation, where step indices are used to ensure well-foundedness. We show that SAIL accepts an asymptotically efficient implementation by presenting algorithms and data structures for its implementation. When the number of operations (reads and writes) per modifiable is bounded by a constant, we show that change propagation becomes as efficient as in the non-imperative case. The general case incurs a slowdown that is logarithmic in the maximum number of such operations. We describe a prototype implementation of SAIL as a Standard ML library},

	Abstract = {Self-adjusting computation is an evaluation model in which programs can respond efficiently to small changes to their input data by using a change-propagation mechanism that updates computation by re-building only the parts affected by changes. Previous work has proposed language techniques for self-adjusting computation and showed the approach to be effective in a number of application areas. However, due to the complex semantics of change propagation and the indirect nature of previously proposed language techniques, it remains difficult to reason about the efficiency of self-adjusting programs and change propagation.

In this paper, we propose a cost semantics for self-adjusting computation that enables reasoning about its effectiveness. As our source language, we consider a direct-style λ-calculus with first-class mutable references and develop a notion of trace distance for source programs. To facilitate asymptotic analysis, we propose techniques for composing and generalizing concrete distances via trace contexts (traces with holes). We then show how to translate the source language into a self-adjusting target language such that the translation (1) preserves the extensional semantics of the source programs and the cost of from-scratch runs, and (2) ensures that change propagation between two evaluations takes time bounded by their relative distance. We consider several examples and analyze their effectiveness by considering upper and lower bounds.},

	Abstract = {Self-adjusting programs respond automatically and efficiently to input changes by tracking the dynamic data dependences of the computation and incrementally updating the output as needed. In order to identify data dependences, previously proposed approaches require the user to make use of a set of monadic primitives. Rewriting an ordinary program into a self-adjusting program with these primitives, however, can be difficult and error-prone due to various monadic and proper-usage restrictions, some of which cannot be enforced statically. Previous work therefore suggests that self-adjusting computation would benefit from direct language and compiler support.

In this paper, we propose a language-based technique for writing and compiling self-adjusting programs from ordinary programs. To compile self-adjusting programs, we use a continuation-passing style (cps) transformation to automatically infer a conservative approximation of the dynamic data dependences. To prevent the inferred, approximate dependences from degrading the performance of change propagation, we generate memoized versions of cps functions that can reuse previous work even when they are invoked with different continuations. The approach offers a natural programming style that requires minimal changes to existing code, while statically enforcing the invariants required by self-adjusting computation.

We validate the feasibility of our proposal by extending Standard ML and by integrating the transformation into MLton, a whole-program optimizing compiler for Standard ML. Our experiments indicate that the proposed compilation technique can produce self-adjusting programs whose performance is consistent with the asymptotic bounds and experimental results obtained via manual rewriting (up to a constant factor).},

Programming models that provide appropriate abstractions to decompose data and tasks can simplify parallelization. We show in this work that the same abstractions can enable both parallel and incremental execution. We present a novel algorithm for parallel self-adjusting computation. This algorithm extends a deterministic parallel programming model (concurrent revisions) with support for recording and repeating computations. On record, we construct a dynamic dependence graph of the parallel computation. On repeat, we reexecute only parts whose dependencies have changed.

We implement and evaluate our idea by studying five example programs, including a realistic multi-pass CSS layout algorithm. We describe programming techniques that proved particularly useful to improve the performance of self-adjustment in practice. Our final results show significant speedups on all examples (up to 37x on an 8-core machine). These speedups are well beyond what can be achieved by parallelization alone, while requiring a comparable effort by the programmer.},

	Abstract = {Self-adjusting computation offers a language-based approach to writing programs that automatically respond to dynamically changing data. Recent work made significant progress in developing sound semantics and associated implementations of self-adjusting computation for high-level, functional languages. These techniques, however, do not address issues that arise for low-level languages, i.e., stack-based imperative languages that lack strong type systems and automatic memory management. In this paper, we describe techniques for self-adjusting computation which are suitable for low-level languages. Necessarily, we take a different approach than previous work: instead of starting with a high-level language with additional primitives to support self-adjusting computation, we start with a low-level intermediate language, whose semantics is given by a stack-based abstract machine. We prove that this semantics is sound: it always updates computations in a way that is consistent with full reevaluation. We give a compiler and runtime system for the intermediate language used by our abstract machine. We present an empirical evaluation that shows that our approach is efficient in practice, and performs favorably compared to prior proposals.},

	Abstract = {Computational problems that involve dynamic data, such as physics simulations and program development environments, have been an important subject of study in programming languages. Building on this work, recent advances in self-adjusting computation have developed techniques that enable programs to respond automatically and efficiently to dynamic changes in their inputs. Self-adjusting programs have been shown to be efficient for a reasonably broad range of problems but the approach still requires an explicit programming style, where the programmer must use specific monadic types and primitives to identify, create and operate on data that can change over time.

We describe techniques for automatically translating purely functional programs into self-adjusting programs. In this implicit approach, the programmer need only annotate the (top-level) input types of the programs to be translated. Type inference finds all other types, and a type-directed translation rewrites the source program into an explicitly self-adjusting target program. The type system is related to information-flow type systems and enjoys decidable type inference via constraint solving. We prove that the translation outputs well-typed self-adjusting programs and preserves the source program's input-output behavior, guaranteeing that translated programs respond correctly to all changes to their data. Using a cost semantics, we also prove that the translation preserves the asymptotic complexity of the source program.},

	Abstract = {Application data often changes slowly or incrementally over time. Since incremental changes to input often result in only small changes in output, it is often feasible to respond to such changes asymptotically more efficiently than by re-running the whole computation. Traditionally, realizing such asymptotic efficiency improvements requires designing problem-specific algorithms known as dynamic or incremental algorithms, which are often significantly more complicated than conventional algorithms to design, analyze, implement, and use. A long-standing open problem is to develop techniques that automatically transform conventional programs so that they correctly and efficiently respond to incremental changes.

In this paper, we describe a significant step towards solving the problem of automatic incrementalization: a programming language and a compiler that can, given a few type annotations describing what can change over time, compile a conventional program that assumes its data to be static (unchanging over time) to an incremental program. Based on recent advances in self-adjusting computation, including a theoretical proposal for translating purely functional programs to self-adjusting programs, we develop techniques for translating conventional Standard ML programs to self-adjusting programs. By extending the Standard ML language, we design a fully featured programming language with higher-order features, a module system, and a powerful type system, and implement a compiler for this language. The resulting programming language, LML, enables translating conventional programs decorated with simple type annotations into incremental programs that can respond to changes in their data correctly and efficiently.

We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach by considering a range of benchmarks involving lists, vectors, and matrices, as well as a ray tracer. For these benchmarks, our compiler incrementalizes existing code with only trivial amounts of annotation. The resulting programs are often asymptotically more efficient, leading to orders of magnitude speedups in practice.},

	Abstract = {We present techniques for incremental computing by introducing adaptive functional programming. As an adaptive program executes, the underlying system represents the data and control dependences in the execution in the form of a dynamic dependence graph. When the input to the program changes, a change propagation algorithm updates the output and the dynamic dependence graph by propagating changes through the graph and re-executing code where necessary. Adaptive programs adapt their output to any change in the input, small or large.We show that adaptivity techniques are practical by giving an efficient implementation as a small ML library. The library consists of three operations for making a program adaptive, plus two operations for making changes to the input and adapting the output to these changes. We give a general bound on the time it takes to adapt the output, and based on this, show that an adaptive Quicksort adapts its output in logarithmic time when its input is extended by one key.To show the safety and correctness of the mechanism we give a formal definition of AFL, a call-by-value functional language extended with adaptivity primitives. The modal type system of AFL enforces correct usage of the adaptivity mechanism, which can only be checked at run time in the ML library. Based on the AFL dynamic semantics, we formalize thechange-propagation algorithm and prove its correctness.},

                 abstract type members and its mixture of nominal and
                 structural typing through the use of refinement types. The
                 core formalism makes no attempt to model inheritance and
                 mixin composition. DOT normalizes Scala's type system by
                 unifying the constructs for type members and by providing
                 classical intersection and union types which simplify
                 greatest lower bound and least upper bound computations.
                 In this paper, we present the DOT calculus, both formally
                 and informally. We also discuss our work-in-progress to

	Abstract = {Given a structure for a first-order language L, two objects of its domain can be indiscernible relative to the properties expressible in L, without using the equality symbol, and without actually being the same. It is this relation that interests us in this paper. It is called Leibniz equality. In the paper we study systematically the problem of its definibility mainly for classes of structures that are the models of some equality-free universal Horn class in an infinitary language L κκ , where κ is an infinite regular cardinal.},

@article{Blelloch90,
	Abstract = {This paper introduces techniques for compiling the nested parallelism of collection-oriented languages onto existing parallel hardware. Programmers of parallel machines encounter nested parallelism whenever they write a routine that performs parallel operations, and then want to call that routine itself in parallel. This occurs naturally in many applications. Most parallel systems, however, do not permit the expression of nested parallelism. This forces the programmer to exploit only one level of parallelism or to implement nested parallelism themselves. Both of these alternatives tend to produce code that is harder to maintain and less modular than code described at a higher level with nested parallel constructs. Not permitting the expression of nested parallelism is analogous to not permitting nested loops in serial languages. This paper describes issues and techniques for taking high-level descriptions of parallelism in the form of operations on nested collections and automatically translating them into flat, single-level parallelism. A compiler that translates a subset of a collection-oriented language,Paralation Lisp, into the instruction set of a flat virtual machine is presented. The instructions of the virtual machine are simple instructions on vectors of atomic values, and can be implemented on a broad class of target architectures, including vector machines, single-instruction parallel machines, and multiple-instruction parallel machines. We have implemented the instructions on the Connection Machine computer (CM-2), a massively parallel, single-instruction computer. As an illustration of the compiler techniques, the paper presents a quicksort example. The example has been tested on the CM-2. The speed of the compiled sort is only a factor of 3 slower than that of the fastest CM-2 sort.},

	Abstract = {{A type system is a syntactic method for automatically checking the absence of certain erroneous behaviors by classifying program phrases according to the kinds of values they compute. The study of type systems--and of programming languages from a type-theoretic perspective-has important applications in software engineering, language design, high-performance compilers, and security.<br /> <br /> This text provides a comprehensive introduction both to type systems in computer science and to the basic theory of programming languages. The approach is pragmatic and operational; each new concept is motivated by programming examples and the more theoretical sections are driven by the needs of implementations. Each chapter is accompanied by numerous exercises and solutions, as well as a running implementation, available via the Web. Dependencies between chapters are explicitly identified, allowing readers to choose a variety of paths through the material.<br /> <br /> The core topics include the untyped lambda-calculus, simple type systems, type reconstruction, universal and existential polymorphism, subtyping, bounded quantification, recursive types, kinds, and type operators. Extended case studies develop a variety of approaches to modeling the features of object-oriented languages.}},

	Abstract = {We show how a simple semantic characterization of normalization by evaluation for the λ βη -calculus can be extended to a similar construction for normalization of terms in the computational λ-calculus. Specifically, we show that a suitable residualizing interpretation of base types, constants, and computational effects allows us to extract a syntactic normal form from a term's denotation. The required interpretation can itself be constructed as the meaning of a suitable functional program in an ML-like language, leading directly to a practical normalization algorithm. The results extend easily to product and sum types, and can be seen as a formal basis for call-by-value type-directed partial evaluation.},

	Abstract = {A functional p rarr;e (procedure rarr;expression) that inverts the evaluation functional for typed lambda;-terms in any model of typed lambda;-calculus containing some basic arithmetic is defined. Combined with the evaluation functional, p rarr;e yields an efficient normalization algorithm. The method is extended to lambda;-calculi with constants and is used to normalize (the lambda;-representations of) natural deduction proofs of (higher order) arithmetic. A consequence of theoretical interest is a strong completeness theorem for beta; eta;-reduction. If two lambda;-terms have the same value in some model containing representations of the primitive recursive functions (of level 1) then they are probably equal in the beta; eta;-calculus },

@incollection{Emir07Patterns,
	Abstract = {Data in object-oriented programming is organized in a hierarchy of classes. The problem of object-oriented pattern matching is how to explore this hierarchy from the outside. This usually involves classifying objects by their run-time type, accessing their members, or determining some other characteristic of a group of objects. In this paper we compare six different pattern matching techniques: object-oriented decomposition, visitors, type-tests/type-casts, typecase, case classes, and extractors. The techniques are compared on nine criteria related to conciseness, maintainability and performance. The paper introduces case classes and extractors as two new pattern-matching methods and shows that their combination works well for all of the established criteria.},

@incollection{Hajiyev06CodeQuest,
	Abstract = {Source code querying tools allow programmers to explore relations between different parts of the code base. This paper describes such a tool, named codeQuest. It combines two previous proposals, namely the use of logic programming and database systems. As the query language we use safe Datalog , which was originally introduced in the theory of databases. That provides just the right level of expressiveness; in particular recursion is indispensable for source code queries. Safe Datalog is like Prolog, but all queries are guaranteed to terminate, and there is no need for extra-logical annotations. Our implementation of Datalog maps queries to a relational database system. We are thus able to capitalise on the query optimiser provided by such a system. For recursive queries we implement our own optimisations in the translation from Datalog to SQL. Experiments confirm that this strategy yields an efficient, scalable code querying system.},

	Abstract = { ABSTRACT Higher-order languages such as Haskell encourage the programmer to build abstractions by composing functions. A good compiler must inline many of these calls to recover an efficiently executable program. In principle, inlining is dead simple: just replace the call of a function by an instance of its body. But any compiler-writer will tell you that inlining is a black art, full of delicate compromises that work together to give good performance without unnecessary code bloat. The purpose of this paper is, therefore, to articulate the key lessons we learned from a full-scale ``production'' inliner, the one used in the Glasgow Haskell compiler. We focus mainly on the algorithmic aspects, but we also provide some indicative measurements to substantiate the importance of various aspects of the inliner. },

@inproceedings{Arvind13,
	Abstract = {Programmers who need high performance currently rely on low-level, architecture-specific programming models (e.g. OpenMP for CMPs, CUDA for GPUs, MPI for clusters). Performance optimization with these frameworks usually requires expertise in the specific programming model and a deep understanding of the target architecture. Domain-specific languages (DSLs) are a promising alternative, allowing compilers to map problem-specific abstractions directly to low-level architecture-specific programming models. However, developing DSLs is difficult, and using multiple DSLs together in a single application is even harder because existing compiled solutions do not compose together. In this paper, we present four new performance-oriented DSLs developed with Delite, an extensible DSL compilation framework. We demonstrate new techniques to compose compiled DSLs embedded in a common backend together in a single program and show that generic optimizations can be applied across the different DSL sections. Our new DSLs are implemented with a small number of reusable components (less than 9 parallel operators total) and still achieve performance up to 125x better than library implementations and at worst within 30\% of optimized stand-alone DSLs. The DSLs retain good performance when composed together, and applying cross-DSL optimizations results in up to an additional 1.82x improvement.},

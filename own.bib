	Abstract = {In language-oriented programming and modeling, software developers are largely concerned with the definition of domain-specific languages (DSLs) and their composition. While various implementation techniques and frameworks exist for defining DSLs, language composition has not obtained enough attention and is not well-enough understood. In particular, there is a lack of precise terminology for describing observations about language composition in theory and in existing language-development systems. To clarify the issue, we specify five forms of language composition: language extension, language restriction, language unification, self-extension, and extension composition. We illustrate this classification by various examples and apply it to discuss the performance of different language-development systems with respect to language composition. We hope that the terminology provided by our classification will enable more precise communication on language composition.},

	Abstract = {
The C preprocessor is commonly used to implement
variability. Given a feature selection, code fragments
can be excluded from compilation with \#ifdef and similar
directives. However, the token-based nature of the C preprocessor
makes variability implementation difficult and errorprone.
Additionally, variability mechanisms are intertwined
with macro definitions, macro expansion, and file inclusion.
To determine whether a code fragment is compiled, the entire
file must be preprocessed. We present a partial preprocessor
that preprocesses file inclusion and macro expansion, but
retains variability information for further analysis.We describe
the mechanisms of the partial preprocessor, provide a full
implementation, and present some initial experimental results.
The partial preprocessor is part of a larger endeavor in
the TypeChef project to check variability implementations
(syntactic correctness, type correctness) in C projects such as
the Linux kernel.

	Abstract = {
What is modularity? Which kind of modularity should developers strive for?
Despite decades of research on modularity, these basic questions have
no definite answer. We submit that the common understanding of
modularity, and in particular its notion of information hiding, is 
deeply rooted in classical logic.
We analyze how classical modularity, based on classical logic, fails to 
address the needs of developers of large software systems, and
encourage researchers to explore alternative visions of
modularity, based on nonclassical logics, and henceforth called
nonclassical
modularity.

	Abstract = {
A software product line (SPL) is a family of related software products, from which users can derive a product that fulfills their needs.
Often, users expect a product to have specific non-functional properties, for example, to not exceed a footprint limit or to respond in a given time frame. Unfortunately, it is usually not feasible to generate and measure non-functional properties for each possible product of an SPL in isolation, because an SPL can contain millions of products. Hence, we propose an approach to \emph{estimate} each product's non-functional properties in advance, based on the product's configuration. To this end, we approximate non-functional properties \emph{per features} and per feature interaction. We generate and measure a small set of products and approximated non-functional properties by comparing the measurements. Our approach is implementation independent and language independent. We present three different approaches with different trade-offs regarding accuracy and required number of measurements. With nine case studies, we demonstrate that our approach can predict non-functional properties with an accuracy of 2\%.

	Abstract = {
In many projects, lexical preprocessors are used to manage
different variants of the project (using conditional compilation)
and to define compile-time code transformations (using
macros). Unfortunately, while being a simply way to implement
variability, conditional compilation and lexical macros
hinder automatic analysis, even though such analysis would
be urgently needed to combat variability-induced complexity.
To analyze code with its variability, we need to parse
it without preprocessing it. However, current parsing solutions
use heuristics, support only a subset of the language, or
suffer from exponential explosion. As part of the TypeChef
project, we contribute a novel variability-aware parser that
can parse unpreprocessed code without heuristics in practicable
time. Beyond the obvious task of detecting syntax errors,
our parser paves the road for further analysis, such as
variability-aware type checking. We implement variabilityaware
parsers for Java and GNU C and demonstrate practicability
by parsing the product line MobileMedia and the
entire X86 architecture of the Linux kernel with 6065 variable
features.

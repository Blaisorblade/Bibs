We have formalized in Agda a practical conversion checking algorithm for a dependent type theory with one universe {\`a} la Russell, natural numbers, and {$\eta$}-equality for {$\Pi$} types. We prove the algorithm correct via a Kripke logical relation parameterized by a suitable notion of equivalence of terms. We then instantiate the parameterized fundamental lemma twice: once to obtain canonicity and injectivity of type formers, and once again to prove the completeness of the algorithm. Our proof relies on inductive-recursive definitions, but not on the uniqueness of identity proofs.

In dependently-typed proof assistants where proofs by induction are just recursive functional programs, the termination checker is an integral component of the trusted core, as validity of proofs depend on termination. However, a rigorous integration of full-fledged sized types into dependent type theory is lacking so far. Such an integration is non-trivial, as explicit sizes in proof terms might get in the way of equality checking, making terms appear distinct that should have the same semantics. In this article, we integrate dependent types and sized types with higher-rank size polymorphism, which is essential for generic programming and abstraction. We introduce a size quantifier {\^a} which lets us ignore sizes in terms for equality checking, alongside with a second quantifier {\^I} for abstracting over sizes that do affect the semantics of types and terms. Judgmental equality is decided by an adaptation of normalization-by-evaluation for our new type theory, which features type shape-directed reflection and reification. It follows that subtyping and type checking of normal forms are decidable as well, the latter by a bidirectional algorithm.},

  abstract = {We observe that normalization by evaluation for simply-typed lambda-calculus with weak coproducts can be carried out in a weak bi-cartesian closed category of presheaves equipped with a monad that allows us to perform case distinction on neutral terms of sum type. The placement of the monad influences the normal forms we obtain: for instance, placing the monad on coproducts gives us eta-long beta-pi normal forms where pi refers to permutation of case distinctions out of elimination positions. We further observe that placing the monad on every coproduct is rather wasteful, and an optimal placement of the monad can be determined by considering polarized simple types inspired by focalization. Polarization classifies types into positive and negative, and it is sufficient to place the monad at the embedding of positive types into negative ones. We consider two calculi based on polarized types: pure call-by-push-value (CBPV) and polarized lambda-calculus, the natural deduction calculus corresponding to focalized sequent calculus. For these two calculi, we present algorithms for normalization by evaluation. We further discuss different implementations of the monad and their relation to existing normalization proofs for lambda-calculus with sums.

  abstract = {Recent work on adaptive functional programming (AFP) developed techniques for writing programs that can respond to modifications to their data by performing change propagation. To achieve this, executions of programs are represented with dynamic dependence graphs (DDGs) that record data dependences and control dependences in a way that a change-propagation algorithm can update the computation as if the program were from scratch, by re-executing only the parts of the computation affected by the changes. Since change-propagation only re-executes parts of the computation, it can respond to certain incremental modifications asymptotically faster than recomputing from scratch, potentially offering significant speedups. Such asymptotic speedups, however, are rare: for many computations and modifications, change propagation is no faster than recomputing from scratch. In this article, we realize a duality between dynamic dependence graphs and memoization, and combine them to give a change-propagation algorithm that can dramatically increase computation reuse. The key idea is to use DDGs to identify and re-execute the parts of the computation that are affected by modifications, while using memoization to identify the parts of the computation that remain unaffected by the changes. We refer to this approach as self-adjusting computation. Since DDGs are imperative, but (traditional) memoization requires purely functional computation, reusing computation correctly via memoization becomes a challenge. We overcome this challenge with a technique for remembering and reusing not just the results of function calls (as in conventional memoization), but their executions represented with DDGs. We show that the proposed approach is realistic by describing a library for self-adjusting computation, presenting efficient algorithms for realizing the library, and describing and evaluating an implementation. Our experimental evaluation with a variety of applications, ranging from simple list primitives to more sophisticated computational geometry algorithms, shows that the approach is effective in practice: compared to recomputing from-scratch; self-adjusting programs respond to small modifications to their data orders of magnitude faster.},

It is proposed that many computer systems will need to become provenance-aware in order to provide satisfactory accountability, reproducibility, and trust for scientific or other high-value data. To date, there is not a consensus concerning appropriate formal models or security properties for provenance. In previous work, we introduced a formal framework for provenance security and proposed formal definitions of properties called disclosure and obfuscation. In this article, we study refined notions of positive and negative disclosure and obfuscation in a concrete setting, that of a general-purpose programing language. Previous models of provenance have focused on special-purpose languages such as workflows and database queries. We consider a higher-order, functional language with sums, products, and recursive types and functions, and equip it with a tracing semantics in which traces themselves can be replayed as computations. We present an annotation-propagation framework that supports many provenance views over traces, including standard forms of provenance studied previously. We investigate some relationships among provenance views and develop some partial solutions to the disclosure and obfuscation problems, including correct algorithms for disclosure and positive obfuscation based on trace slicing.},

In this paper, we present our ongoing work on designing a parallel algorithm for the dynamic trees problem, which requires computing a property of a forest as the forest undergoes changes. Our algorithm allows insertion and/or deletion of both vertices and edges anywhere in the input and performs updates in parallel. We obtain our algorithm by applying a dynamization technique called self-adjusting computation to the classic algorithm of Miller and Reif for tree contraction.},

  abstract = {Slot and van Emde Boas' weak invariance thesis states that reasonable machines can simulate each other within a polynomially overhead in time. Is {$\lambda$}-calculus a reasonable machine? Is there a way to measure the computational complexity of a {$\lambda$}-term? This paper presents the first complete positive answer to this long-standing problem. Moreover, our answer is completely machine-independent and based over a standard notion in the theory of {$\lambda$}-calculus: the length of a leftmost-outermost derivation to normal form is an invariant cost model. Such a theorem cannot be proved by directly relating {$\lambda$}-calculus with Turing machines or random access machines, because of the size explosion problem: there are terms that in a linear number of steps produce an exponentially long output. The first step towards the solution is to shift to a notion of evaluation for which the length and the size of the output are linearly related. This is done by adopting the linear substitution calculus (LSC), a calculus of explicit substitutions modelled after linear logic proof nets and admitting a decomposition of leftmost-outermost derivations with the desired property. Thus, the LSC is invariant with respect to, say, random access machines. The second step is to show that LSC is invariant with respect to the {$\lambda$}-calculus. The size explosion problem seems to imply that this is not possible: having the same notions of normal form, evaluation in the LSC is exponentially longer than in the {$\lambda$}-calculus. We solve such an impasse by introducing a new form of shared normal form and shared reduction, deemed useful. Useful evaluation avoids those steps that only unshare the output without contributing to {$\beta$}-redexes, i.e. the steps that cause the blow-up in size. The main technical contribution of the paper is indeed the definition of useful reductions and the thorough analysis of their properties.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we examine the evolution of the impact of non-elite journals. We attempt to answer two questions. First, what fraction of the top-cited articles are published in non-elite journals and how has this changed over time. Second, what fraction of the total citations are to non-elite journals and how has this changed over time. We studied citations to articles published in 1995-2013. We computed the 10 most-cited journals and the 1000 most-cited articles each year for all 261 subject categories in Scholar Metrics. We marked the 10 most-cited journals in a category as the elite journals for the category and the rest as non-elite. There are two conclusions from our study. First, the fraction of top-cited articles published in non-elite journals increased steadily over 1995-2013. While the elite journals still publish a substantial fraction of high-impact articles, many more authors of well-regarded papers in diverse research fields are choosing other venues. The number of top-1000 papers published in non-elite journals for the representative subject category went from 149 in 1995 to 245 in 2013, a growth of 64\%. Looking at broad research areas, 4 out of 9 areas saw at least one-third of the top-cited articles published in non-elite journals in 2013. For 6 out of 9 areas, the fraction of top-cited papers published in non-elite journals for the representative subject category grew by 45\% or more. Second, now that finding and reading relevant articles in non-elite journals is about as easy as finding and reading articles in elite journals, researchers are increasingly building on and citing work published everywhere. Considering citations to all articles, the percentage of citations to articles in non-elite journals went from 27\% in 1995 to 47\% in 2013. Six out of nine broad areas had at least 50\% of citations going to articles published in non-elite journals in 2013.},

  abstract = {The zipper type provides the ability to efficiently edit tree-shaped data in a purely functional setting by providing constant time edits at a focal point in an immutable structure. It is used in a number of applications and is widely applicable for manipulating tree-shaped data structures. The traditional zipper suffers from two major limitations, however. First, it operates only on homogeneous types. That is to say, every node the zipper visits must have the same type. In practice, many tree-shaped types do not satisfy this condition, and thus cannot be handled by the traditional zipper. Second, the traditional zipper involves a significant amount of boilerplate code. A custom implementation must be written for each type the zipper traverses. This is error prone and must be updated whenever the type being traversed changes. The generic zipper presented in this paper overcomes these limitations. It operates over any type and requires no boilerplate code to be written by the user. The only restriction is that the types traversed must be instances of the Data class from the Scrap your Boilerplate framework},

Thus while SYB allows the concise expression of many traversals, its use incurs a significant runtime cost. Existing techniques for optimizing other generic-programming systems are not able to eliminate this overhead. This paper presents an optimization that completely eliminates this cost. Essentially, it is a partial evaluation that takes advantage of domain-specific knowledge about the structure of SYB. It optimizes SYB-style traversals to be as fast as handwritten, non-generic code, and benchmarks show that this optimization improves the speed of SYB-style code by an order of magnitude or more.},

In the last decades, different parser generators emerged to allow the construction of parsers from a BNF-like specification. However, still today, many parsers are handwritten, or are only partly generated, and include various hacks to deal with different peculiarities in programming languages. The main problem is that current declarative syntax definition techniques are based on pure context-free grammars, while many constructs found in programming languages require context information. In this paper we propose a parsing framework that embraces context information in its core. Our framework is based on data-dependent grammars, which extend context-free grammars with arbitrary computation, variable binding and constraints. We present an implementation of our framework on top of the Generalized LL (GLL) parsing algorithm, and show how common idioms in syntax of programming languages such as (1) lexical disambiguation filters, (2) operator precedence, (3) indentation-sensitive rules, and (4) conditional preprocessor directives can be mapped to data-dependent grammars. We demonstrate the initial experience with our framework, by parsing more than 20000 Java, C\#, Haskell, and OCaml source files.},

Relational program verification can be used for reasoning about a broad range of properties, including equivalence and refinement, and specialized notions such as continuity, information flow security or relative cost. In a higher-order setting, relational program verification can be achieved using relational refinement type systems, a form of refinement types where assertions have a relational interpretation. Relational refinement type systems excel at relating structurally equivalent terms but provide limited support for relating terms with very different structures. We present a logic, called Relational Higher Order Logic (RHOL), for proving relational properties of a simply typed {\^I}\guillemotright{}-calculus with inductive types and recursive definitions. RHOL retains the type-directed flavour of relational refinement type systems but achieves greater expressivity through rules which simultaneously reason about the two terms as well as rules which only contemplate one of the two terms. We show that RHOL has strong foundations, by proving an equivalence with higher-order logic (HOL), and leverage this equivalence to derive key meta-theoretical properties: subject reduction, admissibility of a transitivity rule and set-theoretical soundness. Moreover, we define sound embeddings for several existing relational type systems such as relational refinement types and type systems for dependency analysis and relative cost, and we verify examples that were out of reach of prior work.},

The central idea behind our semantics is that instead of tracking the exact type of a mutable reference in a possible world our model keeps track of the approximate type. While high-level languages like ML and Java do not themselves support storage of impredicative existential packages in mutable cells, this feature is essential when representing ML function closures, that is, in a target language for typed closure conversion of ML programs. 1}

  abstract = {Proof-carrying code (PCC) is a framework for mechanically verifying the safety of machine language programs. A program that is successfully verified by a PCC system is guaranteed to be safe to execute, but this safety guarantee is contingent upon the correctness of various trusted components. For instance, in traditional PCC systems the trusted computing base includes a large set of low-level typing rules. Foundational PCC systems seek to minimize the size of the trusted computing base. In particular, they eliminate the need to trust complex, low-level type systems by providing machine-checkable proofs of type soundness for real machine languages.

In this thesis, I demonstrate the use of logical relations for proving
the soundness of type systems for mutable state. Specifically, I
focus on type systems that ensure the safe allocation, update, and
reuse of memory. For each type in the language, I define logical
relations that explain the meaning of the type in terms of the
operational semantics of the language. Using this model of types, I
prove each typing rule as a lemma.

The major contribution is a model of System F with general references
-- that is, mutable cells that can hold values of any closed
type including other references, functions, recursive types, and
impredicative quantified types. The model is based on ideas from both
possible worlds and the indexed model of Appel and McAllester.

I show how the model of mutable references is encoded in higher-order
logic. I also show how to construct an indexed possible-worlds model for a von Neumann machine. The latter is used in the Princeton Foundational PCC system to prove type safety for a full-fledged low-level typed assembly language. Finally, I present a semantic model for a region calculus that supports type-invariant references as well as memory reuse.},

We have discovered that a direct proof of transitivity of that model does not go through, leaving the ``PER'' status of the model in question. We show how to extend the Appel-McAllester model to obtain a logical relation that we can prove is transitive, as well as sound and complete with respect to contextual equivalence. We then augment this model to support relational reasoning in the presence of quantified types.Step-indexed relations are indexed not just by types, but also by the number of steps available for future evaluation. This stratification is essential for handling various circularities, from recursive functions, to recursive types, to impredicative polymorphism. The resulting construction is more elementary than existing logical relations which require complex machinery such as domain theory, admissibility, syntactic minimal invariance, and {$\top$} {$\top$}-closure.},

  abstract = {Mitchell's notion of representation independence is a particularly useful application of Reynolds' relational parametricity -- two different implementations of an abstract data type can be shown contextually equivalent so long as there exists a relation between their type representations that is preserved by their operations. There have been a number of methods proposed for proving representation independence in various pure extensions of System F (where data abstraction is achieved through existential typing), as well as in Algol- or Java-like languages (where data abstraction is achieved through the use of local mutable state). However, none of these approaches addresses the interaction of existential type abstraction and local state. In particular, none allows one to prove representation independence results for generative ADTs -- i.e. ADTs that both maintain some local state and define abstract types whose internal representations are dependent on that local state. In this paper, we present a syntactic, logical-relations-based method for proving representation independence of generative ADTs in a language supporting polymorphic types, existential types, general recursive types, and unrestricted ML-style mutable references. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by using it to prove several interesting contextual equivalences that involve a close interaction between existential typing and local state, as well as some well-known equivalences from the literature (such as Pitts and Stark's "awkward" example) that have caused trouble for previous logical-relations-based methods. The success of our method relies on two key technical innovations. First, in order to handle generative ADTs, we develop a possible-worlds model in which relational interpretations of types are allowed to grow over time in a manner that is tightly coupled with changes to some local state. Second, we employ a step-indexed stratification of possible worlds, which facilitates a simplified account of mutable references of higher type.},

The primary challenge with this integration is preserving parametricity: even dynamically-typed code should satisfy it once it has been cast to a universal type. Ahmed et al. (2011) employ runtime type generation in the polymorphic blame calculus to preserve parametricity, but a proof that it does so has been elusive. Matthews and Ahmed (2008) gave a proof of parametricity for a closely related system that combines ML and Scheme, but later found a flaw in their proof. In this paper we present an improved version of the polymorphic blame calculus and we prove that it satisfies relational parametricity. The proof relies on a step-indexed Kripke logical relation. The step-indexing is required to make the logical relation well-defined in the case for the dynamic type. The possible worlds include the mapping of generated type names to their types and the mapping of type names to relations. We prove the Fundamental Property of this logical relation and that it is sound with respect to contextual equivalence. To demonstrate the utility of parametricity in the polymorphic blame calculus, we derive two free theorems.},

This article focuses on the theory and practice underpinning our use of Nuprl for much of the last decade. We discuss innovative elements of type theory, including new type constructors such as unions and dependent intersections, our theory of classes, and our theory of event structures.

We also discuss the innovative architecture of Nuprl as a distributed system and as a transactional database of formal mathematics using the notion of abstract object identifiers. The database has led to an independent project called the Formal Digital Library, FDL, now used as a repository for Nuprl results as well as selected results from HOL, MetaPRL, and PVS. We discuss Howe's set theoretic semantics that is used to relate such disparate theories and systems as those represented by these provers.},

Here we investigate an alternative approach employing a recursively defined normalisation function which we show to be terminating and which reflects and preserves conversion. We apply our approach to the simply typed {$\lambda$}-calculus with explicit substitutions and {$\beta\eta$}-equality, a system which is not strongly normalising. We also show how the construction can be extended to system T with the usual {$\beta$}-rules for the recursion combinator. Our approach is practical, since it does verify an actual implementation of normalisation which, unlike normalisation by evaluation, is first order. An important feature of our approach is that we are using logical relations to establish equational soundness (identity of normal forms reflects the equational theory), instead of the usual syntactic reasoning using the Church\textendash{}Rosser property of a term rewriting system.},

We show soundness and completeness among the rules, the algorithm, and the tree semantics. We also prove soundness and a restricted form of completeness for the model. To address the second question, we show that to every pair of types in the subtype relation we can associate a term whose denotation is the uniquely determined coercion map between the two types.

Unfortunately, path-dependent types are not well-understood, and have been a roadblock in grounding the Scala type system on firm theory. We study several calculi for path-dependent types. We present DOT which captures the essence - DOT stands for Dependent Object Types. We explore the design space bottom-up, teasing apart inherent from accidental complexities, while fully mechanizing our models at each step. Even in this simple setting, many interesting patterns arise from the interaction of structural and nominal features. Whereas our simple calculus enjoys many desirable and intuitive properties, we demonstrate that the theory gets much more complicated once we add another Scala feature, type refinement, or extend the subtyping relation to a lattice.

This is bad because low-level code in unsafe languages attracts security vulnerabilities and because development is far less productive, with PL advances mostly lost on programmers operating under tight performance constraints. High-level languages provide memory safety out of the box, but they are deemed too slow and unpredictable for serious system software.   Recent years have seen a surge in staging and generative programming: the key idea is to use high-level languages and their abstraction power as glorified macro systems to compose code fragments in first-order, potentially domain-specific, intermediate languages, from which fast C can be emitted. But what about security? Since the end result is still C code, the safety guarantees of the high-level host language are lost.   In this paper, we extend this generative approach to emit ACSL specifications along with C code. We demonstrate that staging achieves ``abstraction without regret'' for verification: we show how high-level programming models, in particular higher-order composable contracts from dynamic languages, can be used at generation time to compose and generate first-order specifications that can be statically checked by existing tools. We also show how type classes can automatically attach invariants to data types, reducing the need for repetitive manual annotations.   We evaluate our system on several case studies that varyingly exercise verification of memory safety, overflow safety, and functional correctness. We feature an HTTP parser that is (1) fast (2) high-level: implemented using staged parser combinators (3) secure: with verified memory safety. This result is significant, as input parsing is a key attack vector, and vulnerabilities related to HTTP parsing have been documented in all widely-used web servers.},

In the case of Scala, it has been shown that its formal model, the Dependent Object Types (DOT) calculus, cannot simultaneously support key metatheoretic properties such as environment narrowing and subtyping transitivity, which are usually required for a type soundness proof. Moreover, Scala and many other realistic languages lack a general substitution property. The first contribution of this paper is to demonstrate how type soundness proofs for advanced, polymorphic, type systems can be carried out with an operational semantics based on high-level, definitional interpreters, implemented in Coq. We present the first mechanized soundness proofs in this style for System F and several extensions, including mutable references. Our proofs use only straightforward induction, which is significant, as the combination of big-step semantics, mutable references, and polymorphism is commonly believed to require coinductive proof techniques. The second main contribution of this paper is to show how DOT-like calculi emerge from straightforward generalizations of the operational aspects of F, exposing a rich design space of calculi with path-dependent types inbetween System F and DOT, which we dub the System D Square. By working directly on the target language, definitional interpreters can focus the design space and expose the invariants that actually matter at runtime. Looking at such runtime invariants is an exciting new avenue for type system design.},

In dependently-typed programming languages, such relations and uniformity proofs can be expressed internally, and generated as a program translation. We present a new parametricity translation for a significant fragment of Coq. Previous translations of parametrically polymorphic propositions allowed non-uniformity. For example, on related instantiations, a function may return propositions that are logically inequivalent (e.g. True and False). We show that uniformity of polymorphic propositions is not achievable in general. Nevertheless, our translation produces proofs that the two propositions are logically equivalent and also that any two proofs of those propositions are related. This is achieved at the cost of potentially requiring more assumptions on the instantiations, requiring them to be isomorphic in the worst case. Our translation augments the previous one for Coq by carrying and compositionally building extra proofs about parametricity relations. It is made easier by a new method for translating inductive types and pattern matching. The new method builds upon and generalizes previous such translations for dependently-typed programming languages. Using reification and reflection, we have implemented our translation as Coq programs. We obtain several stronger free theorems applicable to an ongoing compiler-correctness project. Previously, proofs of some of these theorems took several hours to finish.},

This notion nicely subsumes standard inference systems and their inductive and coinductive interpretation, while providing more flexibility. Indeed, the classical results on the existence and constructive characterization of least and greatest fixed points can be extended to our generalized framework, interpreting recursive definitions as fixed points which are not necessarily the least, nor the greatest one. This allows formal reasoning in cases where the inductive and coinductive interpretation do not provide the intended meaning, or are mixed together.},

In this paper, we show how patch theory in the style of the Darcs version control system can be developed in homotopy type theory. We reformulate patch theory using the tools of homotopy type theory, and clearly separate formal theories of patches from their interpretation in terms of basic revision control mechanisms.  A patch theory is presented by a higher inductive type. Models of a patch theory are functions from that type, which, because function are functors, automatically preserve the structure of patches. Several standard tools of homotopy theory come into play, demonstrating the use of these methods in a practical programming context.}

Unstructured revision control systems are purely text-based and solve conflicts based on textual similarity. Structured revision control systems are tailored to specific languages and use language-specific knowledge for conflict resolution. We propose semistructured revision control systems that inherit the strengths of both: the generality of unstructured systems and the expressiveness of structured systems. The idea is to provide structural information of the underlying software artifacts --- declaratively, in the form of annotated grammars. This way, a wide variety of languages can be supported and the information provided can assist in the automatic resolution of two classes of conflicts: ordering conflicts and semantic conflicts. The former can be resolved independently of the language and the latter using specific conflict handlers. We have been developing a tool that supports semistructured merge and conducted an empirical study on 24 software projects developed in Java, C\#, and Python comprising 180 merge scenarios. We found that semistructured merge reduces the number of conflicts in 60\% of the sample merge scenarios by, on average, 34\%, compared to unstructured merge. We found also that renaming is challenging in that it can increase the number of conflicts during semistructured merge, and that a combination of unstructured and semistructured merge is a pragmatic way to go.},

Understanding this nature will have significant implications on research in this area, for example, on the efficiency of interaction-detection or performance-prediction techniques. A set of preliminary results as well as a discussion of possible experimental setups and corresponding challenges give us confidence that this endeavor is within reach but requires a collaborative effort of the community.},

  abstract = {Plotkin (1975) showed that the lambda calculus is a good model of the evaluation process for call-by-name functional programs. Reducing programs to constants or lambda abstractions according to the leftmost-outermost strategy exactly mirrors execution on an abstract machine like Landin\&apos;s SECD machine. The machine-based evaluator returns a constant or the token closure if and only if the standard reduction sequence starting at the same program will end in the same constant or in some lambda abstraction. However, the calculus does not capture the sharing of the evaluation of arguments that lazy implementations use to speed up the execution. More precisely, a lazy implementation evaluates procedure arguments only when needed and then only once. All other references to the formal procedure parameter re-use the value of the first argument evaluation. The mismatch between the operational semantics of the lambda calculus and the actual behavior of the prototypical implementation is a major obstacle for compiler writers. Unlike implementors of the leftmost-outermost strategy or of a call-by-value language, implementors of lazy systems cannot easily explain the behavior of their evaluator in terms of source level syntax. Hence, they often cannot explain why a certain syntactic transformation `works' and why another doesn\&apos;t. In this paper we develop an equational characterization of the most popular lazy implementation technique \textendash{} traditionally called `call-by-need' \textendash{} and prove it correct with respect to the original lambda calculus. The theory is a strictly smaller theory than Plotkin\&apos;s call-by-name lambda calculus. Immediate applications of the theory concern the correctness proofs of a number of implementation strategies, e.g. the call-by-need continuation passing transformation and the realization of sharing via assignments. Some of this material first appeared in a paper presented at the 1995 ACM Conference on the Principles of Programming Languages. The paper was a joint effort with Maraist, Odersky and Wadler, who had independently developed a different equational characterization of call-by-need. We contrast our work with that of Maraist et al. in the body of this paper where appropriate.},

With the addition of control delimiters, the continuations become composable and the calculi become more expressive. We present a fine-grained analysis of control delimiters and formalise that their addition corresponds to the addition of a single dynamically-scoped variable modelling the special top-level continuation. From a type perspective, the dynamically-scoped variable requires effect annotations. In the presence of control, the dynamically-scoped variable can be interpreted in a purely functional way by applying a store-passing style. At the type level, the effect annotations are mapped within standard classical logic extended with the dual of implication, namely subtraction. A continuation-passing-style transformation of lambda-calculus with control and subtraction is defined. Combining the translations provides a decomposition of standard CPS transformations for delimited continuations. Incidentally, we also give a direct normalisation proof of the simply-typed lambda-calculus with control and subtraction.},

Built on our experience with Shark, Spark SQL lets Spark programmers leverage the benefits of relational processing (e.g. declarative queries and optimized storage), and lets SQL users call complex analytics libraries in Spark (e.g. machine learning). Compared to previous systems, Spark SQL makes two main additions. First, it offers much tighter integration between relational and procedural processing, through a declarative DataFrame API that integrates with procedural Spark code. Second, it includes a highly extensible optimizer, Catalyst, built using features of the Scala programming language, that makes it easy to add composable rules, control code generation, and define extension points. Using Catalyst, we have built a variety of features (e.g. schema inference for JSON, machine learning types, and query federation to external databases) tailored for the complex needs of modern data analysis. We see Spark SQL as an evolution of both SQL-on-Spark and of Spark itself, offering richer APIs and optimizations while keeping the benefits of the Spark programming model.},

The aim is to study singleton types and to take a canny step towards more complex dependent subtyping systems. Singleton types have applications in the use of type systems for specification and program extraction: given a program P we can form the very tight specification \{P\} which is met uniquely by P. Singletons integrate abbreviational definitions into a type system: the hypothesis x: \{M\} asserts x=M. The addition of singleton types is a non-conservative extension of familiar subtyping theories. In our system, more terms are typable and previously typable terms have more (non-dependent) types.},

Reynolds' original work exploited the typing discipline of the polymorphically typed lambda-calculus System F, but there is now considerable interest in extending relational parametricity to type systems that are richer and more expressive than that of System F. This paper constructs parametric models of predicative and impredicative dependent type theory. The significance of our models is twofold. Firstly, in the impredicative variant we are able to deduce the existence of initial algebras for all indexed=functors. To our knowledge, ours is the first account of parametricity for dependent types that is able to lift the useful deduction of the existence of initial algebras in parametric models of System F to the dependently typed setting. Secondly, our models offer conceptual clarity by uniformly expressing relational parametricity for dependent types in terms of reflexive graphs, which allows us to unify the interpretations of types and kinds, instead of taking the relational interpretation of types as a primitive notion. Expressing our model in terms of reflexive graphs ensures that it has canonical choices for the interpretations of the standard type constructors of dependent type theory, except for the interpretation of the universe of small types, where we formulate a refined interpretation tailored for relational parametricity. Moreover, our reflexive graph model opens the door to generalisations of relational parametricity, for example to higher-dimensional relational parametricity.},

Completeness for standard models only holds when increasing the class of models, e.g., to cartesian closed categories. Similarly, dependent type theory is complete for locally cartesian closed categories. However, it is usually difficult to establish the coherence of interpretations of dependent type theory, i.e., to show that the interpretations of equal expressions are indeed equal. Several classes of models have been used to remedy this problem.We contribute to this investigation by giving a semantics that is both coherent and sufficiently general for completeness while remaining relatively easy to compute with. Our models interpret types of Martin-L{\"o}f's extensional dependent type theory as sets indexed over posets or, equivalently, as fibrations over posets. This semantics can be seen as a generalization to dependent type theory of the interpretation of intuitionistic first-order logic in Kripke models. This yields a simple coherent model theory with respect to which simple and dependent type theory are sound and complete.},

Different languages often make use of similar-looking constructions. We propose a generic model of abstract syntax trees capable of representing a wide range of typed languages. Syntactic constructs can be composed in a modular fashion enabling reuse of abstract syntax and syntactic processing within and across languages. Building on previous methods of encoding extensible data types in Haskell, our model is a pragmatic solution to Wadler's "expression problem". Its practicality has been confirmed by its use in the implementation of the embedded language Feldspar.},

  abstract = {Machine-checked proofs of properties of programming languages have become acritical need, both for increased confidence in large and complex designsand as a foundation for technologies such as proof-carrying code. However, constructing these proofs remains a black art, involving many choices in the formulation of definitions and theorems that make a huge cumulative difference in the difficulty of carrying out large formal developments. There presentation and manipulation of terms with variable binding is a key issue. We propose a novel style for formalizing metatheory, combining locally nameless representation of terms and cofinite quantification of free variable names in inductivedefinitions of relations on terms (typing, reduction, ...). The key technical insight is that our use of cofinite quantification obviates the need for reasoning about equivariance (the fact that free names can be renamed in derivations); in particular, the structural induction principles of relations defined using cofinite quantification are strong enough for metatheoretic reasoning, and need not be explicitly strengthened. Strong inversion principles follow (automatically, in Coq) from the induction principles. Although many of the underlying ingredients of our technique have been used before, their combination here yields a significant improvement over other methodologies using first-order representations, leading to developments that are faithful to informal practice, yet require noexternal tool support and little infrastructure within the proof assistant. We have carried out several large developments in this style using the Coq proof assistant and have made them publicly available. Our developments include type soundness for System F sub; and core ML (with references, exceptions, datatypes, recursion, and patterns) and subject reduction for the Calculus of Constructions. Not only do these developments demonstrate the comprehensiveness of our approach; they have also been optimized for clarity and robustness, making them good templates for future extension.},

  abstract = {A definitional interpreter defines the semantics of an object language in terms of the (well-known) semantics of a host language, enabling understanding and validation of the semantics through execution. Combining a definitional interpreter with a separate type system requires a separate type safety proof. An alternative approach, at least for pure object languages, is to use a dependently-typed language to encode the object language type system in the definition of the abstract syntax. Using such intrinsically-typed abstract syntax definitions allows the host language type checker to verify automatically that the interpreter satisfies type safety. Does this approach scale to larger and more realistic object languages, and in particular to languages with mutable state and objects?  In this paper, we describe and demonstrate techniques and libraries in Agda that successfully scale up intrinsically-typed definitional interpreters to handle rich object languages with non-trivial binding structures and mutable state. While the resulting interpreters are certainly more complex than the simply-typed {$\lambda$}-calculus interpreter we start with, we claim that they still meet the goals of being concise, comprehensible, and executable, while guaranteeing type safety for more elaborate object languages. We make the following contributions: (1) A dependent-passing style technique for hiding the weakening of indexed values as they propagate through monadic code. (2) An Agda library for programming with scope graphs and frames, which provides a uniform approach to dealing with name binding in intrinsically-typed interpreters. (3) Case studies of intrinsically-typed definitional interpreters for the simply-typed {$\lambda$}-calculus with references (STLC+Ref) and for a large subset of Middleweight Java (MJ).},

A derivation step is considered correct if the new program preserves the total correctness of the old program. This requirement is expressed as a relation of (correct) refinement between nondeterministic program statements. The properties of this relation are studied in detail. The usual sequential statement constructors are shown to be monotone with respect to this relation and it is shown how refinement between statements can be reduced to a proof of total correctness of the refining statement. A special emphasis is put on the correctness of replacement steps, where some component of a program is replaced by another component. A method by which assertions can be added to statements to justify replacements in specific contexts is developed. The paper extends the weakest precondition technique of Dijkstra to proving correctness of larger program derivation steps, thus providing a unified framework for the axiomatic, the stepwise refinement and the transformational approach to program construction and verification.},

Inherent defects at the most basic level cause them to be both fat and weak: their primitive word-at-a-time style of programming inherited from their common ancestor\textemdash{}the von Neumann computer, their close coupling of semantics to state transitions, their division of programming into a world of expressions and a world of statements, their inability to effectively use powerful combining forms for building new programs from existing ones, and their lack of useful mathematical properties for reasoning about programs.
An alternative functional style of programming is founded on the use of combining forms for creating programs. Functional programs deal with structured data, are often nonrepetitive and nonrecursive, are hierarchically constructed, do not name their arguments, and do not require the complex machinery of procedure declarations to become generally applicable. Combining forms can use high level programs to build still higher level ones in a style not possible in conventional languages.
Associated with the functional style of programming is an algebra of programs whose variables range over programs and whose operations are combining forms. This algebra can be used to transform programs and to solve equations whose ``unknowns'' are programs in much the same way one transforms equations in high school algebra. These transformations are given by algebraic laws and are carried out in the same language in which programs are written. Combining forms are chosen not only for their programming power but also for the power of their associated algebraic laws. General theorems of the algebra give the detailed behavior and termination conditions for large classes of programs.
 A new class of computing systems uses the functional programming style both in its programming language and in its state transition rules. Unlike von Neumann languages, these systems have semantics loosely coupled to states\textemdash{}only one state transition occurs per major computation.},

Our recursion scheme allows the programmer to implement a tree traversal and then apply it to compact graph representations of trees instead. The resulting graph traversals avoid recomputation of intermediate results for shared nodes -- even if intermediate results are used in different contexts. Consequently, this approach leads to asymptotic speedup proportional to the compression provided by the graph representation. In general, however, this sharing of intermediate results is not sound. Therefore, we complement our implementation of the recursion scheme with a number of correspondence theorems that ensure soundness for various classes of traversals. We illustrate the practical applicability of the implementation as well as the complementing theory with a number of examples.},

The proof of completeness relies on two key tools: (1) the definition of a strong call-by-need calculus where reduction may be performed inside any context, and (2) the use of non-idempotent intersection types. More precisely, terms admitting a {\^I}{$^2$}-normal form in pure lambda calculus are typable, typability implies (weak) normalisation in the strong call-by-need calculus, and weak normalisation in the strong call-by-need calculus implies normalisation in the strong call-by-need strategy.

We join the foundational concepts of both of these to obtain monadic type systems. Essentially, monadic type systems inherit the parameterized higher-order type structure of pure type systems and the monadic term and type structure used to capture computational effects in the theory of computational monads. We demonstrate that monadic type systems nicely characterize previous work and suggest how they can support several new theoretical and practical applications.

A technical foundation for monadic type systems is laid by recasting and scaling up the main results from pure type systems (confluence, subject reduction, strong normalisation for particular classes of systems, etc.) and from operational presentations of computational monads (notions of operational equivalence based on applicative similarity, co-induction proof techniques).

We demonstrate the use of monadic type systems with case studies of several call-by-value and call-by-name systems. Our framework allows to capture the restriction to value polymorphism in the type structure and is flexible enough to accommodate extensions of the type system, e.g., with higher-order polymorphism. The theoretical foundations make monadic type systems well-suited as a typed intermediate language for compilation and specialization of higher-order, strict and non-strict functional programs. The monadic structure guarantees sound compile-time optimizations and the parameterized type structure guarantees sufficient expressiveness.},

This framework, that we call "Pure Pattern Type Systems", is particularly well-suited for the foundations of programming (meta)languages and proof assistants since it provides in a fully unified setting higher-order capabilities and pattern matching ability together with powerful type systems. We prove some standard properties like confluence and subject reduction for the case of a syntactic theory and under a syntactical restriction over the shape of patterns. We also conjecture the strong normalization of typable terms. This work should be seen as a contribution to a formal connection between logics and rewriting, and a step towards new proof engines based on the Curry-Howard isomorphism.},

Static name resolution and type checking prevent partially-correct code from being compiled and executed. Yet, allowing programmers to test critical paths in a program without worrying about the consistency of the entire code base is crucial to fast prototyping and agile development. This is where ScalaDyno comes in: it allows partially-correct programs to be compiled and executed, while shifting compile-time errors to program runtime. The key insight in ScalaDyno is that name and type errors affect limited areas of the code, which can be replaced by instructions to output the respective errors at runtime. This allows byte code generation and execution for partially correct programs, thus allowing Python or JavaScript-like fast prototyping in Scala. This is all done without sacrificing name resolution, full type checking and optimizations for the correct parts of the code -- they are still performed, but without getting in the way of agile development. Finally, for release code or sensitive refactoring, runtime errors can be disabled, thus allowing full static name resolution and type checking typical of the Scala compiler.},

We use Scala macros to analyse the grammar specification at compile-time and remove composition, leaving behind an efficient top-down, recursive-descent parser. We compare our macro-based approach to a staging-based approach using the LMS framework, and provide an experience report in which we discuss the advantages and drawbacks of both methods. Our library outperforms Scala's standard parser combinators on a set of benchmarks by an order of magnitude, and is 2x faster than code generated by LMS.},

The idea underlying defunctionalization is encoding a functional value as first-order data, and then realizing the applications of the encoded function via an apply function. Although this process is simple enough, problems arise when defunctionalization is used in a polymorphic language. In such a language, a functional argument of a higher-order function can take different type instances in different applications. As a consequence, its associated apply function can be untypable in the source language. In the paper we present a defunctionalization transformation which preserves typability. Moreover, the transformation imposes no restriction on functional arguments of recursive functions, and it handles functions as results as well as functions encapsulated in constructors. The key to this success is the use of type information in the defunctionalization transformation. Run-time characteristics are preserved by defunctionalization; hence, there is no performance improvement coming from the transformation itself. However closures need not be implemented to compile the transformed program.},

  abstract = {There are two approaches to formalizing the syntax of typed object languages in a proof assistant or programming language. The extrinsic approach is to first define a type that encodes untyped object expressions and then make a separate definition of typing judgements over the untyped terms. The intrinsic approach is to make a single definition that captures well-typed object expressions, so ill-typed expressions cannot even be expressed. Intrinsic encodings are attractive and naturally enforce the requirement that metalanguage operations on object expressions, such as substitution, respect object types. The price is that the metalanguage types of intrinsic encodings and operations involve non-trivial dependency, adding significant complexity. This paper describes intrinsic-style formalizations of both simply-typed and polymorphic languages, and basic syntactic operations thereon, in the Coq proof assistant. The Coq types encoding object-level variables (de Bruijn indices) and terms are indexed by both type and typing environment. One key construction is the boot-strapping of definitions and lemmas about the action of substitutions in terms of similar ones for a simpler notion of renamings. In the simply-typed case, this yields definitions that are free of any use of type equality coercions. In the polymorphic case, some substitution operations do still require type coercions, which we at least partially tame by uniform use of heterogeneous equality.},

  abstract = {Intersection types are well known to type theorists mainly for two reasons. Firstly, they type all and only the strongly normalizable lambda terms. Secondly, the intersection type operator is a meta-level operator, that is, there is no direct logical counterpart in the Curry\textendash{}Howard isomorphism sense. In particular, its meta-level nature implies that it does not correspond to the intuitionistic conjunction. The intersection type system is naturally a type inference system (system {\`a} la Curry), but the meta-level nature of the intersection operator does not allow to easily design an equivalent typed system (system {\`a} la Church). There are many proposals in the literature to design such systems, but none of them gives an entirely satisfactory answer to the problem. In this paper, we will review the main results in the literature both on the logical interpretation of intersection types and on proposed typed lambda calculi. The core of this paper is a new proposal for a true intersection typed lambda calculus, without any meta-level notion. Namely, any typable term (in the intersection type inference) has a corresponding typed term (which is the same as the untyped term by erasing the type decorations and the typed term constructors) with the same type, and vice versa. The main idea is to introduce a relevant parallel term constructor which corresponds to the intersection type constructor, in such a way that terms in parallel share the same resources, that is, the same context of free typed variables. Three rules allow us to generate all typed terms. The first two rules, Application and Lambda-abstraction, are performed on all the components of a parallel term in a synchronized way. Finally, via the third rule of Local Renaming, once a free typed variable is bounded by lambda-abstraction, each of the terms in parallel can do its local renaming, with type refinement, of that particular resource.},

In that paper, we have evaluated the performance of this indexing mechanism in the case of queries containing a single predicate.

An indexing technique is presented that supports an efficient evaluation of nested predicates for queries involving class hierarchies. A preliminary comparison of the proposed indexing technique with other techniques is presented. A first extension of this work is to define cost formulas for the proposed index organization and to compare it with other organizations, such as the multi-index and inherited-multi-index organizations. A second extension is to define indexing techniques to support alternative predicates on properties that are semantically equivalent. In addition to these, an important issue concerns indexing support for the use of methods in queries},

The object-oriented paradigm removes this difficulty by introducing the notion of nested objects, which allows the value of an object attribute to be another object or a set of other objects. This means that a class consists of a set of attributes, and the values of the attributes are objects that belong to other classes; that is, the definition of a class forms a hierarchy of classes. All attributes of the nested classes are nested attributes of the root of the hierarchy. A branch of such hierarchy is called a path. In this article, we address the problem of index configuration for a given path. We first summarize some basic concepts, and introduce the concept of index configuration for a path. Then we present cost formulas to evaluate the costs of the various configurations. Finally, we present the algorithm that determines the optimal configuration, and show its correctness.},

Our approach is founded on a novel formal operational semantics for GPU kernels termed \emph{synchronous, delayed visibility (SDV)} semantics, which captures the execution of a GPU kernel by multiple groups of threads. The SDV semantics provides operational definitions for barrier divergence and for both inter- and intra-group data races. We build on the semantics to develop a method for reducing the task of verifying a massively parallel GPU kernel to that of verifying a sequential program. This completely avoids the need to reason about thread interleavings, and allows existing techniques for sequential program verification to be leveraged. We describe an efficient encoding of data race detection and propose a method for automatically inferring the loop invariants that are required for verification. We have implemented these techniques as a practical verification tool, GPUVerify, that can be applied directly to OpenCL and CUDA source code. We evaluate GPUVerify with respect to a set of 162 kernels drawn from public and commercial sources. Our evaluation demonstrates that GPUVerify is capable of efficient, automatic verification of a large number of real-world kernels.},

We show that this construction generalizes to a large class of categories with metric-space structure on each set of morphisms: the exact nature of the objects is less important. In particular, the construction immediately applies to categories where the objects are ultrametric spaces with `extra structure', and where the morphisms preserve this extra structure. The generalization is inspired by classical domain-theoretic work by Smyth and Plotkin. For many of the categories we consider, there is a natural subcategory in which each set of morphisms is required to be a compact metric space. Our setting allows for a proof that such a subcategory always inherits solutions of recursive equations from the full category. As another application, we present a construction that relates solutions of generalized domain equations in the sense of Smyth and Plotkin to solutions of equations in our class of categories. Our primary motivation for solving generalized recursive metric-space equations comes from recent and ongoing work on Kripke-style models in which the sets of worlds must be recursively defined. We show a series of examples motivated by this line of work.},

We wish to implement GDTT with decidable type-checking, while still supporting non-trivial equality proofs that reason about the extensions of guarded recursive constructions. CTT is a variation of Martin-L\textbackslash{}"of type theory in which the identity type is replaced by abstract paths between terms. CTT provides a computational interpretation of functional extensionality, is conjectured to have decidable type checking, and has an implemented type-checker. Our new type theory, called guarded cubical type theory, provides a computational interpretation of extensionality for guarded recursive types. This further expands the foundations of CTT as a basis for formalisation in mathematics and computer science. We present examples to demonstrate the expressivity of our type theory, all of which have been checked using a prototype type-checker implementation, and present semantics in a presheaf category.},

Productivity of recursively defined coinductive programs and proofs is encoded in types using guarded recursion, and can therefore be checked modularly, unlike the syntactic checks implemented in modern proof assistants. The model is based on a category of covariant presheaves over a category of time objects, and quantification over clocks is modelled using a presheaf of clocks. To model the clock irrelevance axiom, crucial for programming with coinductive types, types must be interpreted as presheaves orthogonal to the object of clocks. In the case of dependent types, this translates to a unique lifting condition similar to the one found in homotopy theoretic models of type theory. Since the universes defined by the standard Hofmann-Streicher construction in this model do not satisfy this property, the universes in GDTT must be indexed by contexts of clock variables. A large and technical part of the paper is devoted to showing that these can be constructed in such a way that inclusions between universes induced by inclusions of clock variable contexts commute on the nose with type operations on the universes.},

They typically have lightweight syntax, weak data privacy, dynamic typing, powerful aggregate data types, and allow execution of the completed parts of incomplete programs. The price of these features comes later in the software life cycle. Scripts are hard to evolve and compose, and often slow. An additional weakness of most scripting languages is lack of support for concurrency - though concurrency is required for scalability and interacting with remote services. This paper reports on the design and implementation of Thorn, a novel programming language targeting the JVM. Our principal contributions are a careful selection of features that support the evolution of scripts into industrial grade programs - e.g., an expressive module system, an optional type annotation facility for declarations, and support for concurrency based on message passing between lightweight, isolated processes. On the implementation side, Thorn has been designed to accommodate the evolution of the language itself through a compiler plugin mechanism and target the Java virtual machine.},

Using that style, individual extensions can be written independently and later be composed to form larger components. These language mechanisms provide a solution to the expression problem.We study the proposed mechanisms in the context of an implicitly typed, purely functional language PolyR. We give a type system for the language and provide rules for a 2-phase transformation: first into an explicitly typed {$\lambda$}-calculus with record polymorphism, and finally to efficient index-passing code. The first phase eliminates sums and cases by taking advantage of the duality with records.We implement a version of PolyR extended with imperative features and pattern matching - we call this language MLPolyR. Programs in MLPolyR require no type annotations - the implementation employs a reconstruction algorithm to infer all types. The compiler generates machine code (currently for PowerPC) and optimizes the representation of sums by eliminating closures generated by the dual construction.},

We describe an effort, currently nearing completion, to address these issues by explicitly providing semantics for threads in the next revision of the C++ standard. Our approach is similar to that recently followed by Java [25], in that, at least for a well-defined and interesting subset of the language, we give sequentially consistent semantics to programs that do not contain data races. Nonetheless, a number of our decisions are often surprising even to those familiar with the Java effort:We (mostly) insist on sequential consistency for race-free programs, in spite of implementation issues that came to light after the Java work. We give no semantics to programs with data races. There are no benign C++ data races. We use weaker semantics for trylock than existing languages or libraries, allowing us to promise sequential consistency with an intuitive race definition, even for programs with trylock. This paper describes the simple model we would like to be able to provide for C++ threads programmers, and explain how this, together with some practical, but often under-appreciated implementation constraints, drives us towards the above decisions.},

(2) A completeness theorem for {$\Lambda$}-terms with type of degree at most two and a companion corollary for {$\Lambda$}-programs have been proved. (3) A new congruence relation for the last-mentioned {$\Lambda$}-terms which is stronger than {$\Lambda$}-convertibility is introduced and proved to have the meaning of a {$\Lambda$}-program equivalence. Moreover, an extension of the paradigms to the synthesis of functions of higher complexity is considered and exemplified.

In this paper we introduce supermonads: an encoding of monadic notions that captures several different generalizations along with a version of the standard library of monadic functions that work uniformly with all of them. As standard Haskell type inference does not work for supermonads due to their generality, our supermonad implementation is accompanied with a language extension, in the form of a plugin for the Glasgow Haskell Compiler (GHC), that allows type inference for supermonads, obviating the need for manual annotations.},

The main novelty of the axiomatization is the fixpoint rule (or coinduction principle), which has the form where P is either a type equality {$\tau$}={$\tau{'}$} or type containment {$\tau\leq\tau{'}$}. We define what it means for a proof (formal derivation) to be formally contractive and show that the fixpoint rule is sound if the proof of the premise A, P {$\vdash$} P is contractive. (A proof of A, P {$\vdash$} P using the assumption axiom is, of course, not contractive.) The fixpoint rule thus allows us to capture a coinductive relation in the fundamentally inductive framework of inference systems. The new axiomatizations are ``leaner'' than previous axiomatizations, particularly so for type containment since no separate axiomatization of type equality is required, as in Amadio and Cardelli's axiomatization. They give rise to a natural operational interpretation of proofs as coercions. In particular, the fixpoint rule corresponds to definition by recursion. Finally, the axiomatization is closely related to (known) efficient algorithms for deciding type equality and type containment. These can be modified to not only decide type equality and type containment, but also construct proofs in our axiomatizations efficiently. In connection with the operational interpretation of proofs as coercions this gives efficient (O(n 2) time) algorithms for constructing efficient coercions from a type to any of its supertypes or isomorphic types.},

When the changes between subsequent runs of the compiler are small, one would hope the compiler to incrementally update its results, resulting in much lower running times. However, the manual construction of an incremental compiler is very hard and error prone and therefore usually not an option. Attribute grammars provide an attractive way of constructing compilers, as they are compositional in nature and allow for aspect oriented programming. In this work we extend previous work on the automatic generation of incremental attribute grammar evaluators, with the purpose of (semi-)automatically generating an incremental compiler from the regular attribute grammar definition, by adding support for incremental evaluation of higher order attributes, a well known extension to the classical attribute grammars that is used in many ways in compiler construction, for example to model different compiler phases.},

This transformation is based on a recent proposal to efficiently implement lazy non-deterministic computations in Haskell into monadic style. We build on this work and define a systematic method to transform lazy functional logic programs into monadic programs with explicit sharing. This results in a transformation scheme which produces high-level and flexible target code. For instance, the target code is parametric w.r.t. the concrete evaluation monad. Thus, different monad instances could, for example, define different search strategies (e.g., depth-first, breadth-first, parallel). We formally describe the basic compilation scheme and some useful extensions. 1}

  abstract = {Object-oriented languages like Java and C\# allow the null value for all references. This supports many flexible patterns, but has led to many errors, security vulnerabilities, and system crashes. \% Static type systems can prevent null-pointer exceptions at compile time, but require annotations, in particular for used libraries. Conservative defaults choose the most restrictive typing, preventing many errors, but requiring a large annotation effort. Liberal defaults choose the most flexible typing, requiring less annotations, but giving weaker guarantees. Trusted annotations can be provided, but are not checked and require a large manual effort. None of these approaches provide a strong guarantee that the checked part of the program is isolated from the unchecked part: even with conservative defaults, null-pointer exceptions can occur in the checked part.   This paper presents Granullar, a gradual type system for null-safety. Developers start out verifying null-safety for the most important components of their applications. At the boundary to unchecked components, runtime checks are inserted by Granullar to guard the verified system from being polluted by unexpected null values. This ensures that null-pointer exceptions can only occur within the unchecked code or at the boundary to checked code; the checked code is free of null-pointer exceptions.   We present Granullar for Java, define the checked-unchecked boundary, and how runtime checks are generated. We evaluate our approach on real world software annotated for null-safety. We demonstrate the runtime checks, and acceptable compile-time and run-time performance impacts. Granullar enables combining a checked core with untrusted libraries in a safe manner, improving on the practicality of such a system.},

IFC is typically enforced via type systems and static analyses or via dynamic execution monitors. The LIO Haskell library, originating in operating systems research, implements a purely dynamic monitor of the sensitivity level of a computation, particularly suitable when data sensitivity levels are only known at runtime. In this paper, we show how to give programmers the flexibility of deferring IFC checks to runtime (as in LIO), while also providing static guarantees---and the absence of runtime checks---for parts of their programs that can be statically verified (unlike LIO). We present the design and implementation of our approach, HLIO (Hybrid LIO), as an embedding in Haskell that uses a novel technique for deferring IFC checks based on singleton types and constraint polymorphism. We formalize HLIO, prove non-interference, and show how interesting IFC examples can be programmed. Although our motivation is IFC, our technique for deferring constraints goes well beyond and offers a methodology for programmer-controlled hybrid type checking in Haskell.},

The language is very strongly typed, and as implemented it incorporates a typechecker which handles polymorphic types and overloaded operators. Functions are defined by a set of recursion equations; the left-hand side of each equation includes a pattern used to determine which equation to use for a given argument. The availability of arbitrary higher-order types allows functions to be defined which 'package' recursion. Lazily-evaluated lists are provided, allowing the use of infinite lists which could be used to provide interactive input/output and concurrency.

The language is ML(1) [Milner 84] and the compiler was first implemented in 1980 as a personal project when I was a postgraduate student at the University of Edinburgh(2). At the time, I was familiar with programming language semantics but knew very little about compiler technology; interpreters had been my main programming concern. Major influences in the design of this compiler have been [Steele 77] [Steele 78] and the implementation folklore for statically and dynamically scoped dialects of Lisp [Allen 78]. As a result, the internal structure of the compiler is fairly unorthodox, if compared for example with [Aho 78]. Anyway, a compiler for a language like ML has to be different. ML is interactive, statically scoped, strongly typed, polymorphic, and has first class higher-order functions, type inference and dynamic allocation. These features preclude many well-known implementation styles, particularly the ones used for Lisp (because of static scoping), the Algol family (because of functional values) and C (because of nested scoping and strong typing). The interaction of these features is what gives ML its ``character'', and makes compilation challenging. The compiler has been recently partially converted to the new ML standard. The major points of interest which are discussed in this paper are: (a) the interactive interpreter-like usage; (b) the polymorphic type inference algorithm; (c) the compilation of pattern matching; (d) the optimization of the representation of user defined data types; (e) the compilation of functional closures, function application and variable access; (f) the intermediate abstract machine and its formal operational semantics; (g) modules and type-safe separate compilation.},

The statically type-preserving interpretations include an evaluator, a compiler (or staged evaluator), a partial evaluator, and call-by-name and call-by-value CPS transformers. Our main idea is to encode HOAS using cogen functions rather than data constructors. In other words, we represent object terms not in an initial algebra but using the coalgebraic structure of the {$\lambda$}-calculus. Our representation also simulates inductive maps from types to types, which are required for typed partial evaluation and CPS transformations. Our encoding of an object term abstracts over the various ways to interpret it, yet statically assures that the interpreters never get stuck. To achieve self-interpretation and show Jones-optimality, we relate this exemplar of higher-rank and higher-kind polymorphism to plugging a term into a context of let-polymorphic bindings.}

  abstract = {To accommodate polymorphic data types and operations, several computer scientists--most notably MacQueen, Plotkin, and Sethi--have proposed formalizing types as ideals. Although this approach is intuitively appealing, the resulting type system is both complex and restrictive because the type constructor that creates function types is not monotonic, and hence not computable. As a result, types cannot be treated as data values, precluding the formalization of type constructors and polymorphic program modules (where types are values) as higher order computable functions. Moreover, recursive definitions of new types do not necessarily have solutions.
This paper proposes a new formulation of types--called intervals--that subsumes the theory of types as ideals, yet avoids the pathologies caused by non-monotonic type constructors. In particular, the set of interval types contains the set of ideal types as a proper subset and all of the primitive type operations on intervals are extensions of the corresponding operations on ideals. Nevertheless, all of the primitive interval type constructors including the function type constructor and type quantifiers are computable operations. Consequently, types are higher order data values that can be freely manipulated within programs.
The key idea underlying the formalization of types as intervals is that negative information should be included in the description of a type. Negative information identifies the finite elements that do not belong to a type, just as conventional, positive information identifies the elements that do. Unless the negative information in a type description is the exact complement of the positive information, the description is partial in the sense that it approximates many different types--an interval of ideals between the positive information and the complement of the negative information. Although programmers typically deal with total (maximal) types, partial types appear to be an essential feature of a comprehensive polymorphic type system that accommodates types as data, just as partial functions are essential in any universal programming language.},

In this paper, we present a small example language in this style. Our design allows the programmer to explicitly mention and pass information between the two fragments.

  abstract = {The increasing importance of parallelism has motivated the creation of better abstractions for writing parallel software, including structured parallelism using nested algorithmic skeletons. Such approaches provide high-level abstractions that avoid common problems, such as race conditions, and often allow strong cost models to be defined. However, choosing a combination of algorithmic skeletons that yields good parallel speedups for a program on some specific parallel architecture remains a difficult task. In order to achieve this, it is necessary to simultaneously reason both about the costs of different parallel structures and about the semantic equivalences between them. This paper presents a new type-based mechanism that enables strong static reasoning about these properties. We exploit well-known properties of a very general recursion pattern, hylomorphisms, and give a denotational semantics for structured parallel processes in terms of these hylomorphisms. Using our approach, it is possible to determine formally whether it is possible to introduce a desired parallel structure into a program without altering its functional behaviour, and also to choose a version of that parallel structure that minimises some given cost model.},

Consequently, the problem of making composition between languages easier by emphasizing code reuse and componentized programming is a topic of increasing interest in research. In fact, it is not uncommon for different languages to share common features, and, because in the same project different DSLs may coexist to model concepts from different problem areas, it is interesting to study ways to develop modular, extensible languages. Earlier work has shown that traits can be used to modularize the semantics of a language implementation; a lot of attention is often spent on embedded DSLs; even when external DSLs are discussed, the main focus is on modularizing the semantics. In this paper we will show a complete trait-based approach to modularize not only the semantics but also the syntax of external DSLs, thereby simplifying extension and therefore evolution of a language implementation. We show the benefits of implementing these techniques using the Scala programming language.},

Applications lie in proof search, logic programming, and logical frameworks based on linear type theories. It is also related to foundational work on term assignment calculi for presentations of the sequent calculus. We define the spine calculus, give translations of {$\lambda\rightarrow\multimap\&\top$} into S\textrightarrow{$\multimap\&\top$} and vice versa, prove their soundness and completeness with respect to typing and reductions, and show that the typable fragment of the spine calculus is strongly normalizing and admits unique canonical, i.e. {$\beta\eta$}-normal, forms.},

  abstract = {Exploiting heterogeneous parallel hardware currently requires mapping application code to multiple disparate programming models. Unfortunately, general-purpose programming models available today can yield high performance but are too low-level to be accessible to the average programmer. We propose leveraging domain-specific languages (DSLs) to map high-level application code to heterogeneous devices. To demonstrate the potential of this approach we present OptiML, a DSL for machine learning. OptiML programs are implicitly parallel and can achieve high performance on heterogeneous hardware with no modification required to the source code. For such a DSL-based approach to be tractable at large scales, better tools are required for DSL authors to simplify language creation and parallelization. To address this concern, we introduce Delite, a system designed specifically for DSLs that is both a framework for creating an implicitly parallel DSL as well as a dynamic runtime providing automated targeting to heterogeneous parallel hardware. We show that OptiML running on Delite achieves single-threaded, parallel, and GPU performance superior to explicitly parallelized MATLAB code in nearly all cases.},

  abstract = {The existing call-by-need {$\lambda$} describe lazy evaluation via equational logics. A programmer can use these logics to safely ascertain whether one term is behaviorally equivalent to another or to determine the value of a lazy program. However, neither of the existing calculi models evaluation in a way that matches lazy implementations. Both calculi suffer from the same two problems. First, the calculi never discard function calls, even after they are completely resolved. Second, the calculi include re-association axioms even though these axioms are merely administrative steps with no counterpart in any implementation. In this paper, we present an alternative axiomatization of lazy evaluation using a single axiom. It eliminates both the function call retention problem and the extraneous re-association axioms. Our axiom uses a grammar of contexts to describe the exact notion of a needed computation. Like its predecessors, our new calculus satisfies consistency and standardization properties and is thus suitable for reasoning about behavioral equivalence. In addition, we establish a correspondence between our semantics and Launchbury's natural semantics.},

To improve the scalability of self-adjusting computation, we present a type system for precise dependency tracking that minimizes the time and space for storing dependency metadata. The type system eliminates an important assumption of prior work that can lead to recording spurious dependencies. We present a type-directed translation algorithm that generates correct self-adjusting programs without relying on this assumption.

Originally motivated by the needs of scientific databases and scientific computation, provenance has also become a major issue for business and government data on the Web. However, so far provenance has been studied only in relatively restrictive settings: typically, for data stored in databases or scientific workflow systems, and processed by query or workflow languages of limited expressiveness. Long-term provenance solutions require an understanding of provenance in other settings, particularly the general-purpose programming or scripting languages that are used to glue different components such as databases, Web services and workflows together. Moreover, what is required is not only an account of mechanisms for recording provenance, but also a theory of what it means for provenance information to explain or justify a computation. In this paper, we begin to outline a such a theory of self-explaining computation. We introduce a model of provenance for a simple imperative language based on operational derivations and explore its properties.},

  abstract = {Nested relational query languages have been explored extensively, and underlie industrial language-integrated query systems such as Microsoft's LINQ. However, relational databases do not natively support nested collections in query results. This can lead to major performance problems: if programmers write queries that yield nested results, then such systems typically either fail or generate a large number of queries. We present a new approach to query shredding, which converts a query returning nested data to a fixed number of SQL queries. Our approach, in contrast to prior work, handles multiset semantics, and generates an idiomatic SQL:1999 query directly from a normal form for nested queries. We provide a detailed description of our translation and present experiments showing that it offers comparable or better performance than a recent alternative approach on a range of examples.},

  abstract = {Tupling is a transformation tactic to obtain new functions, without redundant calls and/or multiple traversals of common inputs. It achieves this feat by allowing each set (tuple) of function calls to be computed recursively from its previous set. In previous works by Chin and Khoo [8,9], a safe (terminating) fold/unfold transformation algorithm was developed for some classes of functions which are guaranteed to be successfully tupled. However, these classes of functions currently usestatic-sized tables for eliminating the redundant calls. As shown by Richard Bird in [3], there are also other classes of programs whose redundant calls could only be eliminated by usingdynamic-sized tabulation. This paper proposes a new solution to dynamic-sized tabulation by an extension to the tupling tactic. Our extension useslambda abstractions which can be viewed as either dynamic-sized tables or applications of the higher-order generalisation technique to facilitate tupling. Significant speedups could be obtained after the transformed programs were vectorised, as confirmed by experiment.},

  abstract = {Common subexpression elimination is a well-known compiler optimisation that saves time by avoiding the repetition of the same computation. In lazy functional languages, referential transparency renders the identification of common subexpressions very simple. More common subexpressions can be recognised because they can be of arbitrary type whereas standard common subexpression elimination only shares primitive values. However, because lazy functional languages decouple program structure from data space allocation and control flow, analysing its effects and deciding under which conditions the elimination of a common subexpression is beneficial proves to be quite difficult. We developed and implemented the transformation for the language Haskell by extending the Glasgow Haskell compiler. On real-world programs the transformation showed nearly no effect. The reason is that common subexpressions whose elimination could speed up programs are uncommon in lazy functional languages.},

Many programmers appreciate the productivity benefits of automatic storage management, freedom from verbose type annotations, and so on. While it is often possible to improve performance substantially by rewriting an application in C or a similar language, very few programmers bother to do so, because of the consequences for human development effort. This paper describes a compiler that makes it possible to have most of the best of both worlds, coding Web applications in a high-level language but compiling to native code with performance comparable to handwritten C code. The source language is Ur/Web, a domain-specific, purely functional, statically typed language for the Web. Through a coordinated suite of relatively straightforward program analyses and algebraic optimizations, we transform Ur/Web programs into almost-idiomatic C code, with no garbage collection, little unnecessary memory allocation for intermediate values, etc. Our compiler is in production use for commercial Web sites supporting thousands of users, and microbenchmarks demonstrate very competitive performance versus mainstream tools.},

With our representation for the reduction machine by the Java language, an L-code program is translated into a Java program simulating the reduction machine.The translated Java programs also run at a reasonable execution speed. Our experiment shows that execution times of translated benchmarks are competitive compared with those in a traditional Haskell interpreter, Hugs, particularly when Glasgow Haskell compiler's STG-level optimizations are applied.},

  abstract = {Incremental computation aims to speed up re-runs of a program after its inputs have been modified slightly. It works by recording a trace of the program's first run and propagating changes through the trace in incremental runs, trying to re-use as much of the original trace as possible. The recent work CostIt is a type and effect system to establish the time complexity of incremental runs of a program, as a function of input changes. However, CostIt is limited in two ways. First, it prohibits input changes that influence control flow. This makes it impossible to type programs that, for instance, branch on inputs that may change. Second, the soundness of CostIt is proved relative to an abstract cost semantics, but it is unclear how the semantics can be realized.   In this paper, we address both these limitations. We present DuCostIt, a re-design of CostIt, that combines reasoning about costs of change propagation and costs of from-scratch evaluation. The latter lifts the restriction on control flow changes. To obtain the type system, we refine Flow Caml, a type system for information flow analysis, with cost effects. Additionally, we inherit from CostIt index refinements to track data structure sizes and a co-monadic type. Using a combination of binary and unary step-indexed logical relations, we prove DuCostIt's cost analysis sound relative to not only an abstract cost semantics, but also a concrete semantics, which is obtained by translation to an ML-like language.},

Techniques based on program analysis, type systems and abstract interpretation are well-studied, but methods for analyzing how the execution costs of two programs compare to each other have not received attention. Naively combining the worst and best case execution costs of the two programs does not work well in many cases because such analysis forgets the similarities between the programs or the inputs. In this work, we propose a relational cost analysis technique that is capable of establishing precise bounds on the difference in the execution cost of two programs by making use of relational properties of programs and inputs. We develop , a refinement type and effect system for a higher-order functional language with recursion and subtyping. The key novelty of our technique is the combination of relational refinements with two modes of typing{\^a}relational typing for reasoning about similar computations/inputs and unary typing for reasoning about unrelated computations/inputs. This combination allows us to analyze the execution cost difference of two programs more precisely than a naive non-relational approach. We prove our type system sound using a semantic model based on step-indexed unary and binary logical relations accounting for non-relational and relational reasoning principles with their respective costs. We demonstrate the precision and generality of our technique through examples.},

Two lingering sources of overhead are the direct costs of memory allocations and write barriers. This paper introduces it allocation folding, an optimization technique where the virtual machine automatically folds multiple memory allocation operations in optimized code together into a single, larger it allocation group. An allocation group comprises multiple objects and requires just a single bounds check in a bump-pointer style allocation, rather than a check for each individual object. More importantly, all objects allocated in a single allocation group are guaranteed to be contiguous after allocation and thus exist in the same generation, which makes it possible to statically remove write barriers for reference stores involving objects in the same allocation group. Unlike object inlining, object fusing, and object colocation, allocation folding requires no special connectivity or ownership relation between the objects in an allocation group. We present our analysis algorithm to determine when it is safe to fold allocations together and discuss our implementation in V8, an open-source, production JavaScript virtual machine. We present performance results for the Octane and Kraken benchmark suites and show that allocation folding is a strong performance improvement, even in the presence of some heap fragmentation. Additionally, we use four hand-selected benchmarks JPEGEncoder, NBody, Soft3D, and Textwriter where allocation folding has a large impact.},

Multiple dispatch offers several well-known advantages over the single dispatching of conventional object-oriented languages, including a simple solution to some kinds of "binary method" problems. MultiJava's multiple dispatch retains Java's existing class-based encapsulation properties. We adapt previous theoretical work to allow compilation units to be statically typechecked modularly and safely, ruling out any link-time or run-time type errors.

Danvy, for example, has conjectured that continuation captures occur in clusters. That is, the same continuation, once captured, is likely to be captured again. As evidence, Danvy cited the use of continuations in a research setting. We report that Danvy's conjecture is somewhat true in the commercial setting of MacScheme+Toolsmith\texttrademark, which provides tools for developing Macintosh user interfaces in Scheme. These include an interrupt-driven event system and multitasking, both implemented by liberal use of continuations.
We describe several implementation strategies for continuations and compare four of them using benchmarks. We conclude that the most popular strategy may have a slight edge when continuations are not used at all, but that other strategies perform better when continuations are used and Danvy's conjecture holds.},

  abstract = {Dependent pattern matching is an intuitive way to write programs and proofs in dependently typed languages. It is reminiscent of both pattern matching in functional languages and case analysis in on-paper mathematics. However, in general it is incompatible with new type theories such as homotopy type theory (HoTT). As a consequence, proofs in such theories are typically harder to write and to understand. The source of this incompatibility is the reliance of dependent pattern matching on the so-called K axiom - also known as the uniqueness of identity proofs - which is inadmissible in HoTT. The Agda language supports an experimental criterion to detect definitions by pattern matching that make use of the K axiom, but so far it lacked a formal correctness proof. In this paper, we propose a new criterion for dependent pattern matching without K, and prove it correct by a translation to eliminators in the style of Goguen et al. (2006). Our criterion both allows more good definitions than existing proposals, and solves a previously undetected problem in the criterion offered by Agda. It has been implemented in Agda and is the first to be supported by a formal proof. Thus it brings the benefits of dependent pattern matching to contexts where we cannot assume K, such as HoTT. It also points the way to new forms of dependent pattern matching, for example on higher inductive types.},

Then, to process a program, one simply follows the binding time information: evaluate compile-time expressions and defer the others to run-time.
Using abstract interpretation, we present a binding time analysis for an untyped functional language which provides an effective treatment of both higher order functions and data structures. To our knowledge it is the first such analysis. It has been implemented and is used in a partial evaluator for a side-effect free dialect of Scheme. The analysis is general enough, however, to be valid for non-strict typed functional languages such as Haskell. Our approach and the system we have developed solve and go beyond the open problem of partially evaluating higher order functions described in [3] since we also provide a method to handle data structures.
Our analysis improves on previous work [5, 15, 4] in that: (1) it treats both higher order functions and data structures, (2) it does not impose syntactic restrictions on the program being processed, and (3) it does not require a preliminary phase to collect the set of possible functions that may occur at each site of application.},

The lambda terms will always be considered up to {$\beta$}-conversion. The types of minimal higher order logic consist of one basic type ``o'' and function types of the form {$\alpha$} \textrightarrow{} {$\beta$}. The chapter also defines other logical connectives. The original logic of Church was formulated for classical logic and had a ground type of individuals. Yet another difference was the introduction of a description operator. It is possible to interpret classical higher order propositional logic in minimal higher order logic. Minimal higher order logic has a direct set-theoretic semantics. Second-order lambda calculus is also introduced in the chapter. One motivation is to provide syntax for polymorphic procedure.},

To date, languages that support intensional polymorphism have required a type-passing (as opposed to type-erasure) interpretation where types are constructed and passed to polymorphic functions at run time. Unfortunately, type-passing suffers from a number of drawbacks: it requires duplication of constructs at the term and type levels, it prevents abstraction, and it severely complicates polymorphic closure conversion.We present a type-theoretic framework that supports intensional polymorphism, but avoids many of the disadvantages of type passing. In our approach, run-time type information is represented by ordinary terms. This avoids the duplication problem, allows us to recover abstraction, and avoids complications with closure conversion. In addition, our type system provides another improvement in expressiveness; it allows unknown types to be refined in place thereby avoiding certain beta-expansions required by other frameworks.},

This technique is considerably simpler and easily generalizes to effectful settings.

This can impede modular programming by forcing mutually-dependent components to be consolidated into a single module. Recently there have been several proposals for module systems that admit cyclic dependencies, but it is not clear how these proposals relate to one another, nor how one might integrate them into an expressive module system such as that of ML.To address this question we provide a type-theoretic analysis of the notion of a recursive module in the context of a "phase-distinction" formalism for higher-order module systems. We extend this calculus with a recursive module mechanism and a new form of signature, called a recursively dependent signature, to support the definition of recursive modules. These extensions are justified by an interpretation in terms of more primitive language constructs. This interpretation may also serve as a guide for implementation.},

We give an account of the Abstraction theorem for a modern module calculus supporting generative and applicative functors, higher-order functors, sealing, and translucent signatures. The main issues to be overcome are: (1) the fact that modules combine both types and terms, so they must be treated as both simultaneously, (2) the effect discipline that models the distinction between transparent and opaque modules, and (3) a very rich language of type constructors supporting singleton kinds. We define logical equivalence for modules and show that it coincides with contextual equivalence. This substantiates the folk theorem that modules are good for data abstraction.

Coercions in F-eta can model subtyping of known types and some displacement of quantifiers, but not subtyping assumptions nor certain forms of delayed type instantiation. We generalize F-eta by allowing abstraction over retyping functions. We follow a general approach where computing with coercions can be seen as computing in the lambda-calculus but keeping track of which parts of terms are coercions. We obtain a language where coercions do not contribute to the reduction but may block it and are thus not erasable. We recover erasable coercions by choosing a weak reduction strategy and restricting coercion abstraction to value-forms or by restricting abstraction to coercions that are polymorphic in their domain or codomain. The latter variant subsumes F-eta, F-sub, and MLF in a unified framework.},

Although they have different reduction strategies and type system features, their proof of soundness and normalization (in the absence of recursion) should be factorizable. This thesis does such a factorization for theoretical type systems featuring recursive types, subtyping, bounded polymorphism, and constraint polymorphism. Interestingly, soundness and normalization for strong reduction imply soundness and normalization for all usual strategies. Our observation is that a generalization of existing coercions permits to describe all type system features stated above in an erasable and composable way. We illustrate this by proposing two concrete type systems: first, an explicit type system with a restricted form of coercion abstraction to express subtyping and bounded polymorphism; and an implicit type system with unrestricted coercion abstraction that generalizes the explicit type system with recursive types and constraint polymorphism---but without the subject reduction property. A side technical result is an adaptation of the step-indexed proof technique for type-soundness to calculi equipped with a strong notion of reduction.},

Our framework allows for a clear separation of language constructs with and without computational content. We also distinguish coherent coercions that are fully erasable from potentially incoherent coercions that suspend the evaluation---and enable the encoding of GADTs. Technically, type coercions that witness subtyping relations between types are replaced by a more expressive notion of typing coercions that witness subsumption relations between typings, e.g. pairs composed of a typing environment and a type. Our calculus is equipped with a strong notion of reduction that allows reduction under abstractions---but we also introduce a form of weak reduction as reduction cannot proceed under incoherent type abstractions.

A partial equivalence relation (PER) is then defined, the domain of which is the total subset of the partial language.

  abstract = {When creating a new domain-specific language (DSL) it is common to embed it as a part of a flexible host language, rather than creating it entirely from scratch. The semantics of an embedded DSL (EDSL) is either given directly as a set of functions (shallow embedding), or an AST is constructed that is later processed (deep embedding). Typically, the deep embedding is used when the EDSL specifies domain-specific optimizations (DSO) in a form of AST transformations. In this paper we show that deep embedding is not necessary to specify most optimizations. We define language semantics as action functions that are executed during parsing. These actions build incrementally a new, arbitrary complex program function. The EDSL designer is able to specify many aspects of the semantics as a runnable code, such as variable scoping rules, custom type checking, arbitrary control flow structures, or DSO. A sufficiently powerful staging mechanism helps assembling the code from different actions, as well as evaluate the semantics in arbitrarily many stages. In the end, we obtain code that is as efficient as one written by hand. We never create any object representation of the code. No external traversing algorithm is used to process the code. All program fragments are functions with their entire semantics embedded within the function bodies. This approach allows reusing the code between EDSL and the host language, as well as combining actions of many different EDSLs.},

  abstract = {Domain-specific languages are becoming increasingly important. Almost every application touches multiple domains. But how to define, use, and combine multiple DSLs within the same application? The most common approach is to split the project along the domain boundaries into multiple pieces and files. Each file is then compiled separately. Alternatively, multiple languages can be embedded in a flexible host language: within the same syntax a new domain semantic is provided. In this paper we follow a less explored route of metamorphic languages. These languages are able to modify their own syntax and semantics on the fly, thus becoming a more flexible host for DSLs. Our language allows for dynamic creation of grammars and switching languages where needed. We achieve this through a novel concept of Syntax-Directed Execution. A language grammar includes semantic actions that are pieces of functional code executed immediately during parsing. By avoiding additional intermediate representation, connecting actions from different languages and domains is greatly simplified. Still, actions can generate highly specialized code though lambda encapsulation and Dynamic Staging.},

The relevant notion of input size is often specific to a datatype, with measures including the length of a list, the maximum element in a list, and the height of a tree. In this work, we give a formal account of the extraction of cost and size recurrences from higher-order functional programs over inductive datatypes. Our approach allows a wide range of programmer-specified notions of size, and ensures that the extracted recurrences correctly predict evaluation cost. To extract a recurrence from a program, we first make costs explicit by applying a monadic translation from the source language to a complexity language, and then abstract datatype values as sizes. Size abstraction can be done semantically, working in models of the complexity language, or syntactically, by adding rules to a preorder judgement. We give several different models of the complexity language, which support different notions of size. Additionally, we prove by a logical relations argument that recurrences extracted by this process are upper bounds for evaluation cost; the proof is entirely syntactic and therefore applies to all of the models we consider.},

This new transformation algorithm leads to a simpler proof of Plotkin's simulation and indifference results.We go on to show how CPS-based control operators similar to, more general then, Scheme's call/cc can be naturally accommodated by the new transformation algorithm. To demonstrate the expressive power of these operators, we use them to present an equivalent but even more concise formulation of the efficient CPS transformation algorithm.

Lambda-dropping a set of recursive equations restores block structure and lexical scope.For lack of scope, recursive equations must carry around all the parameters that any of their callees might possibly need. Both lambda-lifting and lambda-dropping thus require one to compute a transitive closure over the call graph:\&bull; for lambda-lifting: to establish the Def/Use path of each free variable (these free variables are then added as parameters to each of the functions in the call path);\&bull; for lambda-dropping: to establish the Def/Use path of each parameter (parameters whose use occurs in the same scope as their definition do not need to be passed along in the call path).Without free variables, a program is scope-insensitive. Its blocks are then free to float (for lambda-lifting) or to sink (for lambda-dropping) along the vertices of the scope tree.We believe lambda-lifting and lambda-dropping are interesting per se, both in principle and in practice, but our prime application is partial evaluation: except for Malmkj\&aelig;r and \&Oslash;rb\&aelig;k's case study presented at PEPM '95, most polyvariant specializers for procedural programs operate on recursive equations. To this end, in a pre-processing phase, they lambda-lift source programs into recursive equations, As a result, residual programs are also expressed as recursive equations, often with dozens of parameters, which most compilers do not handle efficiently. Lambda-dropping in a post-processing phase restores their block structure and lexical scope thereby significantly reducing both the compile time and the run time of residual programs.},

The idea is that the recursive calls get us 'there' by traversing the first data structure and the returns get us 'back again' while traversing the second data structure. We name this programming pattern of traversing a data structure at call time and another data structure at return time "There And Back Again" (TABA). The TABA pattern directly applies to computing symbolic convolutions and to multiplying polynomials. It also blends well with other programming patterns such as dynamic programming and traversing a list at double speed. We illustrate TABA and dynamic programming with Catalan numbers. We illustrate TABA and traversing a list at double speed with palindromes and we obtain a novel solution to this traditional exercise. Finally, through a variety of tree traversals, we show how to apply TABA to other data structures than lists. A TABA-based function written in direct style makes full use of an ALGOL-like control stack and needs no heap allocation. Conversely, in a TABA-based function written in continuation-passing style and recursively defined over a data structure (traversed at call time), the continuation acts as an iterator over a second data structure (traversed at return time). In general, the TABA pattern saves one from accumulating intermediate data structures at call time.},

differentiate between variations of configurable systems and also

This dissertation shows how to modularly reason about the

programming languages and object-oriented software product lines. In
both domains, modular verification of features can be leveraged to
reason about the behavior of artifacts in which they are included:
fully mechanized metatheory proofs for programming languages can be
synthesized from independently developed proofs, and programs built
from well-formed feature modules are guaranteed to be well-formed
without needing to be typechecked. Modular reasoning about individual

  abstract = {Formalizing meta-theory, or proofs about programming languages, in a proof assistant has many well-known benefits. Unfortunately, the considerable effort involved in mechanizing proofs has prevented it from becoming standard practice. This cost can be amortized by reusing as much of existing mechanized formalizations as possible when building a new language or extending an existing one. One important challenge in achieving reuse is that the inductive definitions and proofs used in these formalizations are closed to extension. This forces language designers to cut and paste existing definitions and proofs in an ad-hoc manner and to expend considerable effort to patch up the results. The key contribution of this paper is the development of an induction technique for extensible Church encodings using a novel reinterpretation of the universal property of folds. These encodings provide the foundation for a framework, formalized in Coq, which uses type classes to automate the composition of proofs from modular components. This framework enables a more structured approach to the reuse of meta-theory formalizations through the composition of modular inductive definitions and proofs. Several interesting language features, including binders and general recursion, illustrate the capabilities of our framework. We reuse these features to build fully mechanized definitions and proofs for a number of languages, including a version of mini-ML. Bounded induction enables proofs of properties for non-inductive semantic functions, and mediating type classes enable proof adaptation for more feature-rich languages.},

Using 3MT, individual language features and their corresponding definitions -- semantic functions, theorem statements and proofs-- can be built separately and then reused to create different languages with fully mechanized meta-theory. 3MT combines modular datatypes and monads to define denotational semantics with effects on a per-feature basis, without fixing the particular set of effects or language constructs. One well-established problem with type soundness proofs for denotational semantics is that they are notoriously brittle with respect to the addition of new effects. The statement of type soundness for a language depends intimately on the effects it uses, making it particularly challenging to achieve modularity. 3MT solves this long-standing problem by splitting these theorems into two separate and reusable parts: a feature theorem that captures the well-typing of denotations produced by the semantic function of an individual feature with respect to only the effects used, and an effect theorem that adapts well-typings of denotations to a fixed superset of effects. The proof of type soundness for a particular language simply combines these theorems for its features and the combination of their effects. To establish both theorems, 3MT uses two key reasoning techniques: modular induction and algebraic laws about effects. Several effectful language features, including references and errors, illustrate the capabilities of 3MT. A case study reuses these features to build fully mechanized definitions and proofs for 28 languages, including several versions of mini-ML with effects.},

This paper addresses a kind of performance problem that often is easy to address but difficult to identify: redundant computations that may be avoided by reusing already computed results for particular inputs, a technique called memoization. To help developers find and use memoization opportunities, we present MemoizeIt, a dynamic analysis that identifies methods that repeatedly perform the same computation. The key idea is to compare inputs and outputs of method calls in a scalable yet precise way. To avoid the overhead of comparing objects at all method invocations in detail, MemoizeIt first compares objects without following any references and iteratively increases the depth of exploration while shrinking the set of considered methods. After each iteration, the approach ignores methods that cannot benefit from memoization, allowing it to analyze calls to the remaining methods in more detail. For every memoization opportunity that MemoizeIt detects, it provides hints on how to implement memoization, making it easy for the developer to fix the performance issue. Applying MemoizeIt to eleven real-world Java programs reveals nine profitable memoization opportunities, most of which are missed by traditional CPU time profilers, conservative compiler optimizations, and other existing approaches for finding performance bugs. Adding memoization as proposed by MemoizeIt leads to statistically significant speedups by factors between 1.04x and 12.93x.},

Even in the sub-area of programming languages, it has been applied to different paradigms, especially the logic, functional and objectoriented ones. Partly because of different past influences, but also because researchers in these communities scarcely talk to each others, concepts have evolved separately, sometimes to the point where it is hard for people in one community to recognize similarities in the work of others, not to speak about cross-fertilization among them. In this paper, we propose a synthesis covering mainly the application of computation reflection to programming languages.

  abstract = {Dataflow languages provide natural support for specifying constraints between objects in dynamic applications, where programs need to react efficiently to changes in their environment. In this article, we show that one-way dataflow constraints, largely explored in the context of interactive applications, can be seamlessly integrated in any imperative language and can be used as a general paradigm for writing performance-critical reactive applications that require efficient incremental computations. In our framework, programmers can define ordinary statements of the imperative host language that enforce constraints between objects stored in special memory locations designated as ``reactive.'' Reactive objects can be of any legal type in the host language, including primitive data types, pointers, arrays, and structures. Statements defining constraints are automatically re-executed every time their input memory locations change, letting a program behave like a spreadsheet where the values of some variables depend on the values of other variables. The constraint-solving mechanism is handled transparently by altering the semantics of elementary operations of the host language for reading and modifying objects. We provide a formal semantics and describe a concrete embodiment of our technique into C/C++, showing how to implement it efficiently in conventional platforms using off-the-shelf compilers. We discuss common coding idioms and relevant applications to reactive scenarios, including incremental computation, observer design pattern, data structure repair, and software visualization. The performance of our implementation is compared to problem-specific change propagation algorithms, as well as to language-centric approaches such as self-adjusting computation and subject/observer communication mechanisms, showing that the proposed approach is efficient in practice.},

  abstract = {Embedded Domain Specific Languages make language design and implementation easier, because lexical and syntactical analysis and part of the semantic checks can be completed by the compiler of the host language. On the other hand, by the nature of embedding, EDSL compilers have to work with a syntax tree that stores no information about the source file processed and the location of the program entities within the source file. This makes it hard to produce user-friendly error messages and connect the generated target code with the source code for debugging and profiling purposes. This lecture note presents this problem in detail and shows possible solutions. The first, lightweight solution uses macro preprocessing. The second one is based on syntax tree transformations to add missing source-related information. This is more powerful, but also more heavyweight. The last technique avoids the problem by turning the embedded language implementation to a standalone one (with own parser) after the experimental phase of the language development process: It turns out that most of the embedded implementation can be reused in the standalone one.},

However, these systems are often implemented in multiple disparate languages and perform code generation in a separate process from program execution, making certain optimizations difficult to engineer. We leverage a popular scripting language, Lua, to stage the execution of a novel low-level language, Terra. Users can implement optimizations in the high-level language, and use built-in constructs to generate and execute high-performance Terra code. To simplify meta-programming, Lua and Terra share the same lexical environment, but, to ensure performance, Terra code can execute independently of Lua's runtime. We evaluate our design by reimplementing existing multi-language systems entirely in Terra. Our Terra-based auto-tuner for BLAS routines performs within 20\% of ATLAS, and our DSL for stencil computations runs 2.3x faster than hand-written C.},

This representation turns out to be expressible accurately in GHC with today's extensions. The resulting list-like structure of datatypes allows for the definition of powerful high-level traversal combinators, which in turn encourage the definition of generic functions in a compositional and concise style. A major plus of the SOP view is that it allows to separate function-specific metadata from the main structural representation and recombining this information later.},

We work in a Curry-style dependent type theory, where the same untyped term may be classified as both the non-indexed and indexed versions of a datatype. Many solutions have been proposed for the problem of dependently typed reuse, but we exploit Curry-style type theory in our solution to not only reuse data and programs, but do so at zero-cost (without a runtime penalty). Our work is an exercise in dependently typed generic programming, and internalizes the process of zero-cost reuse as the identity function in a Curry-style theory.},

  abstract = {Abstract. Although they appear unrelated, the type system of the polymorphic {$\lambda$}-calculus with references and the assertions of concurrent separation logic with first-class locks share a critical feature: an unsound contravariant circularity in their na{\"i}ve semantic model. We developed indirection theory to automatically construct, and cleanly axiomatize, step-indexed approximations to these na{\"i}ve models, as well as a large number of others [HDA10b]. Unfortunately, the previous axiomatization had a flaw. One is usually only interested in using hereditary predicates: those which are closed under the action of approximation. As previously presented, indirection theory allows nonhereditary predicates to exist in certain parts of the construction. Although not fatal, this flaw requires workarounds that are not entirely obvious to the uninitiated. We correct this flaw by presenting a new axiomatization of indirection theory that only permits heredity predicates and show that the new interface is sound by constructing a model. The new axiomatization is somewhat more subtle than the previous one, but it retains the same flavor, cleanliness, and metatheoretic properties. In contrast, the new construction is markedly more complex, especially in a mechanized context. Indeed, our Coq mechanization is one of our key contributions, and accordingly we present it in considerable detail. 1},

However, many concurrent applications require custom synchronization constructs with special-purpose behavior. These constructs present a significant challenge for verification. Like standard constructs, they rely on subtle racy behavior, but unlike standard constructs, they may not have well-understood abstract interfaces. As they are custom built, such constructs are also far more likely to be unreliable. This article examines the formal specification and verification of custom synchronization constructs. Our target is a library of channels used in automated parallelization to enforce sequential behavior between program statements. Our high-level specification captures the conditions necessary for correct execution; these conditions reflect program dependencies necessary to ensure sequential behavior. We connect the high-level specification with the low-level library implementation to prove that a client's requirements are satisfied. Significantly, we can reason about program and library correctness without breaking abstraction boundaries. To achieve this, we use a program logic called iCAP (impredicative Concurrent Abstract Predicates) based on separation logic. iCAP supports both high-level abstraction and low-level reasoning about races. We use this to show that our high-level channel specification abstracts three different, increasingly complex low-level implementations of the library. iCAP's support for higher-order reasoning lets us prove that sequential dependencies are respected, while iCAP's next-generation semantic model lets us avoid ugly problems with cyclic dependencies.},

A new unification algorithm which can cope with set terms is developed and proved to terminate. Moreover, distinguished predicates representing set membership and equality are added to the base language along with their negative counterparts, and SLD resolution is modified accordingly. It is shown that the resulting language allows restricted universal quantifiers in goals and clause bodies to be defined quite simply within the language itself. Finally, abstraction set terms are made available as intensional designations of sets. It is shown that also such terms become directly definable within the language, provided the latter is endowed with negation, which may occur in goals and clause bodies.},

At its heart, this study is guided by duality: each structure for recursion has a dual form, giving perfectly symmetric pairs of equal and opposite data and co-data types for representing recursion in programs. Duality is brought out through a framework presented in sequent style, which inherently includes control effects that are interpreted logically as classical reasoning principles. To accommodate the presence of effects, we give a calculus parameterized by a notion of strategy, which is strongly normalizing for a wide range of strategies. We also present a more traditional calculus for representing effect-free functional programs, but at the cost of losing some of the founding dualities.},

To ensure well-founded recursion in the presence of multiple recursive variables and separate compilation, we track the usage of individual recursive variables, represented statically by "names". So that our type system may eventually be integrated smoothly into ML's, reasoning involving names is only required inside code that uses our recursive construct and need not infect existing ML code, although instrumentation of some existing code can help to improve the precision of our type system.},

  abstract = {Existential types provide a simple and elegant foundation for understanding generative abstract data types, of the kind supported by the Standard ML module system. However, in attempting to extend ML with support for recursive modules, we have found that the traditional existential account of type generativity does not work well in the presence of mutually recursive module definitions. The key problem is that, in recursive modules, one may wish to define an abstract type in a context where a name for the type already exists, but the existential type mechanism does not allow one to do so.We propose a novel account of recursive type generativity that resolves this problem. The basic idea is to separate the act of generating a name for an abstract type from the act of defining its underlying representation.

  abstract = {ML modules and Haskell type classes have proven to be highly effective tools for program structuring. Modules emphasize explicit configuration of program components and the use of data abstraction. Type classes emphasize implicit program construction and ad hoc polymorphism. In this paper, we show how the implicitly-typed style of type class programming may be supported within the framework of an explicitly-typed module language by viewing type classes as a particular mode of use of modules. This view offers a harmonious integration of modules and type classes, where type class features, such as class hierarchies and associated types, arise naturally as uses of existing module-language constructs, such as module hierarchies and type components. In addition, programmers have explicit control over which type class instances are available for use by type inference in a given scope. We formalize our approach as a Harper-Stone-style elaboration relation, and provide a sound type inference algorithm as a guide to implementation.},

  abstract = {Existential types provide a simple and elegant foundation for understanding generative abstract data types of the kind supported by the Standard ML module system. However, in attempting to extend ML with support for recursive modules, we have found that the traditional existential account of type generativity does not work well in the presence of mutually recursive module definitions. The key problem is that, in recursive modules, one may wish to define an abstract type in a context where a name for the type already exists, but the existential type mechanism does not allow one to do so. We propose a novel account of recursive type generativity that resolves this problem. The basic idea is to separate the act of generating a name for an abstract type from the act of defining its underlying representation. To define several abstract types recursively, one may first `forward-declare' them by generating their names, and then supply each one's identity secretly within its own defining expression. Intuitively, this can be viewed as a kind of backpatching semantics for recursion at the level of types. Care must be taken to ensure that a type name is not defined more than once, and that cycles do not arise among `transparent' type definitions.

One of the most difficult problems in the development of such an extension is the double vision problem, which concerns the interaction of recursion and data abstraction. In previous work, I defined a type system called RTG, which solves the double vision problem at the level of a System-F-style core calculus. In this paper, I scale the ideas and techniques of RTG to the level of a recursive ML-style module calculus called RMC, thus establishing that no tradeoff between data abstraction and recursive modules is necessary. First, I describe RMC's typing rules for recursive modules informally and discuss some of the design questions that arose in developing them. Then, I present the formal semantics of RMC, which is interesting in its own right. The formalization synthesizes aspects of both the Definition and the Harper-Stone interpretation of Standard ML, and includes a novel two-pass algorithm for recursive module typechecking in which the coherence of the two passes is emphasized by their representation in terms of the same set of inference rules.},

Mixin modules facilitate recursive linking of separately compiled components, but they are not hierarchically composable and typically do not support type abstraction. We synthesize the complementary advantages of these two mechanisms in a novel module system design we call MixML. A MixML module is like an ML structure in which some of the components are specified but not defined. In other words, it unifies the ML structure and signature languages into one. MixML seamlessly integrates hierarchical composition, translucent MLstyle data abstraction, and mixin-style recursive linking. Moreover, the design of MixML is clean and minimalist; it emphasizes how all the salient, semantically interesting features of the ML module system (as well as several proposed extensions to it) can be understood simply as stylized uses of a small set of orthogonal underlying constructs, with mixin composition playing a central role.},

  abstract = {The method of logical relations is a classic technique for proving the equivalence of higher-order programs that implement the same observable behavior but employ different internal data representations. Although it was originally studied for pure, strongly normalizing languages like System F, it has been extended over the past two decades to reason about increasingly realistic languages. In particular, Appel and McAllester's idea of step-indexing has been used recently to develop syntactic Kripke logical relations for ML-like languages that mix functional and imperative forms of data abstraction. However, while step-indexed models are powerful tools, reasoning with them directly is quite painful, as one is forced to engage in tedious step-index arithmetic to derive even simple results. In this paper, we propose a logic LADR for equational reasoning about higher-order programs in the presence of existential type abstraction, general recursive types, and higher-order mutable state. LADR exhibits a novel synthesis of features from Plotkin-Abadi logic, G{\"o}del-L{\"o}b logic, S4 modal logic, and relational separation logic. Our model of LADR is based on Ahmed, Dreyer, and Rossberg's state-of-the-art step-indexed Kripke logical relation, which was designed to facilitate proofs of representation independence for "state-dependent" ADTs. LADR enables one to express such proofs at a much higher level, without counting steps or reasoning about the subtle, step-stratified construction of possible worlds.},

In this paper, we show how to reason about binary step-indexed logical relations in an abstract and elegant way. Specifically, we define a logic LSLR, which is inspired by Plotkin and Abadi's logic for parametricity, but also supports recursively defined relations by means of the modal "later" operator from Appel, Melli\textbackslash{}`es, Richards, and Vouillon's "very modal model" paper.

This paper develops a type system that is impartial with respect to evaluation order. Evaluation order is implicit in terms, and explicit in types, with by-value and by-name versions of type connectives. A form of intersection type quantifies over evaluation orders, describing code that is agnostic over (that is, polymorphic in) evaluation order. By allowing such generic code, programs can express the by-value and by-name versions of a computation without code duplication. We also formulate a type system that only has by-value connectives, plus a type that generalizes the difference between by-value and by-name connectives: it is either a suspension (by name) or a "no-op" (by value). We show a straightforward encoding of the impartial type system into the more economical one. Then we define an elaboration from the economical language to a call-by-value semantics, and prove that elaborating a well-typed source program, where evaluation order is implicit, produces a well-typed target program where evaluation order is explicit. We also prove a simulation between evaluation of the target program and reductions (either by-value or by-name) in the source program. Finally, we prove that typing, elaboration, and evaluation are faithful to the type annotations given in the source program: if the programmer only writes by-value types, no by-name reductions can occur at run time.},

  abstract = {A general formulation of inductive and recursive definitions in Martin-L{\"o}f's type theory is presented. It extends Backhouse's `Do-It-Yourself Type Theory' to include inductive definitions of families of sets and definitions of functions by recursion on the way elements of such sets are generated. The formulation is in natural deduction and is intended to be a natural generalisation to type theory of Martin-L{\"o}f's theory of iterated inductive definitions in predicate logic. Formal criteria are given for correct formation and introduction rules of a new set former capturing definition by strictly positive, iterated, generalised induction. Moreover, there is an inversion principle for deriving elimination and equality rules from the formation and introduction rules. Finally, there is an alternative schematic presentation of definition by recursion. The resulting theory is a flexible and powerful language for programming and constructive mathematics. We hint at the wealth of possible applications by showing several basic examples: predicate logic, generalised induction, and a formalisation of the untyped lambda calculus.},

  abstract = {Haskell, as implemented in the Glasgow Haskell Compiler (GHC), has been adding new type-level programming features for some time. Many of these features---chiefly: generalized algebraic datatypes (GADTs), type families, kind polymorphism, and promoted datatypes---have brought Haskell to the doorstep of dependent types. Many dependently typed programs can even currently be encoded, but often the constructions are painful. In this dissertation, I describe Dependent Haskell, which supports full dependent types via a backward-compatible extension to today's Haskell. An important contribution of this work is an implementation, in GHC, of a portion of Dependent Haskell, with the rest to follow. The features I have implemented are already released, in GHC 8.0. This dissertation contains several practical examples of Dependent Haskell code, a full description of the differences between Dependent Haskell and today's Haskell, a novel type-safe dependently typed lambda-calculus (called Pico) suitable for use as an intermediate language for compiling Dependent Haskell, and a type inference and elaboration algorithm, Bake, that translates Dependent Haskell to type-correct Pico.},

We describe an implemented technique for producing optimizing compilers for DSELs, based on Kamin\&apos;s idea of DSELs for program generation. The technique uses a data type of syntax for basic types, a set of smart constructors that perform rewriting over those types, some code motion transformations, and a back-end code generator. Domain-specific optimization results from chains of domain-independent rewrites on basic types. New DSELs are defined directly in terms of the basic syntactic types, plus host language functions and tuples. This definition style makes compilers easy to write and, in fact, almost identical to the simplest embedded interpreters. We illustrate this technique with a language Pan for the computationally intensive domain of image synthesis and manipulation.},

  abstract = {Type classes provide a mechanism for varied implementations of standard interfaces. Many of these interfaces are founded in mathematical tradition and so have regularity not only of types but also of properties (laws) that must hold. Types and properties give strong guidance to the library implementor, while leaving freedom as well. Some of this remaining freedom is in how the implementation works, and some is in what it accomplishes.

To give additional guidance to the what, without impinging on the how, this paper proposes a principle of type class morphisms (TCMs), which further refines the compositional style of denotational semantics. The TCM idea is simply that the instance's meaning is the meaning's instance. This principle determines the meaning of each type class instance, and hence defines correctness of implementation. It also serves to transfer laws about a type's semantic model, such as the class laws, to hold for the type itself. In some cases, it also provides a systematic guide to implementation, and in some cases, valuable design feedback.

The paper is illustrated with several examples of types, meanings, and morphisms.},

  year = {2007},
  doi = {10.5075/epfl-thesis-3899},
  abstract = {Pattern matching is a programming language construct considered essential in functional programming. Its purpose is to inspect and decompose data. Instead, object-oriented programming languages do not have a dedicated construct for this purpose. A possible reason for this is that pattern matching is useful when data is defined separately from operations on the data \textendash{} a scenario that clashes with the object-oriented motto of grouping data and operations. However, programmers are frequently confronted with situations where there is no alternative to expressing data and operations separately \textendash{} because most data is neither stored in nor does it originate from an object-oriented context. Consequently, object-oriented programmers, too, are in need for elegant and concise solutions to the problem of decomposing data. To this end, we propose a built-in pattern matching construct compatible with object-oriented programming. We claim that it leads to more concise and readable code than standard object-oriented approaches. A pattern in our approach is any computable way of testing and deconstructing an object and binding relevant parts to local names. We introduce pattern matching in two variants, case classes and extractors. We compare the readability, extensibility and performance of built-in pattern matching in these two variants with standard decomposition techniques. It turns out that standard object-oriented approaches to decomposing data are not extensible. Case classes, which have been studied before, require a low notational overhead, but expose their representation, making them hard to change later. The novel extractor mechanism offers loose coupling and extensibility, but comes with a performance overhead. We present a formalization of object-oriented pattern matching with extractors. This is done by giving definitions and proving standard properties for a calculus that provides pattern matching as described before. We then give a formal, optimizing translation from the calculus including pattern matching to its fragment without pattern matching, and prove it correct. Finally, we consider non-obvious interactions between the pattern matching and parametric polymorphism. We review the technique of generalized algebraic data types from functional programming, and show how it can be carried over to the object-oriented style. The main tool is the extension of the type system with subtype constraints, which leads to a very expressive metatheory. Through this theory, we are able to express patterns that operate on existentially quantified types purely by universally quantified extractors. Emir, Burak},

Sugar libraries are a novel approach for syntactically extending a programming language within the language. A sugar library is like an ordinary library, but can, in addition, export syntactic sugar for using the library. Sugar libraries maintain the composability and scoping properties of ordinary libraries and are hence particularly well-suited for embedding a multitude of domain-specific languages into a host language. They also inherit self-applicability from libraries, which means that sugar libraries can provide syntactic extensions for the definition of other sugar libraries. To demonstrate the expressiveness and applicability of sugar libraries, we have developed SugarJ, a language on top of Java, SDF and Stratego, which supports syntactic extensibility. SugarJ employs a novel incremental parsing technique, which allows changing the syntax within a source file. We demonstrate SugarJ by five language extensions, including embeddings of XML and closures in Java, all available as sugar libraries. We illustrate the utility of self-applicability by embedding XML Schema, a metalanguage to define XML languages.},

While typesmart constructors can be implemented individually, we demonstrate how to derive them automatically from a grammar, so that the grammar remains the sole specification of a language's syntax and is not duplicated. We have integrated support for typesmart constructors into the run-time system of Stratego to enforce usage of typesmart constructors implicitly whenever a regular constructor is called. We evaluate the applicability, performance, and usefulness of typesmart constructors for syntactic constraints in a compiler for MiniJava developed with Spoofax and in various language extensions of Java and Haskell implemented with SugarJ and SugarHaskell.},

They resemble inner classes, which are also defined within a class, but virtual classes are accessed through object instances, not as static components of a class. When used as types, virtual classes depend upon object identity -- each object instance introduces a new family of virtual class types. Virtual classes support large-scale program composition techniques, including higher-order hierarchies and family polymorphism. The original definition of virtual classes in BETA left open the question of static type safety, since some type errors were not caught until runtime. Later the languages Caesar and gbeta have used a more strict static analysis in order to ensure static type safety. However, the existence of a sound, statically typed model for virtual classes has been a long-standing open question. This paper presents a virtual class calculus, VC, that captures the essence of virtual classes in these full-fledged programming languages. The key contributions of the paper are a formalization of the dynamic and static semantics of VC and a proof of the soundness of VC.},

Although recently tools have been put forward to support the language design process, such as language workbenches, these have mostly focused on a syntactic view of languages. While these tools are quite helpful for the development of parsers and editors, they provide little support for the underlying design of the languages. In this paper we illustrate how to support the design of languages by focusing on their semantics first. Specifically, we will show that powerful and general language operators can be employed to adapt and grow sophisticated languages out of simple semantics concepts. We use Haskell as a metalanguage and will associate generic language concepts, such as semantics domains, with Haskell-specific ones, such as data types.

This will reveal some unexpected correlations, such as viewing type classes as language multipliers. We illustrate the viability of our approach with several real-world examples.},

Yet our compilers and development toolchains only provide rudimentary support for these tasks. This paper introduces a programmatic and compiler-centric interface that facilitates refactoring and equational reasoning. To develop our ideas, we have implemented HERMIT, a toolkit enabling informal but systematic transformation of Haskell programs from inside the Glasgow Haskell Compiler's optimization pipeline. With HERMIT, users can experiment with optimizations and equational reasoning, while the tedious heavy lifting of performing the actual transformations is done for them. HERMIT provides a transformation API that can be used to build higher-level rewrite tools. One use-case is prototyping new optimizations as clients of this API before being committed to the GHC toolchain. We describe a HERMIT application - a read-eval-print shell for performing transformations using HERMIT. We also demonstrate using this shell to prototype an optimization on a specific example, and report our initial experiences and remaining challenges.},

This is a serious limitation, as concatMap represents computations on nested streams. The original implementation of Stream Fusion used the Glasgow Haskell Compiler's user-directed rewriting system. A transformation which allows the compiler to fuse many uses of concatMap has previously been proposed, but never implemented, because the host rewrite system was not expressive enough to implement the proposed transformation. In this paper, we develop a custom optimization plugin which implements the proposed concatMap transformation, and study the effectiveness of the transformation in practice. We also provide a new translation scheme for list comprehensions which enables them to be optimized. Within this framework, we extend the transformation to monadic streams. Code featuring uses of concatMap experiences significant speedup when compiled with this optimization. This allows Stream Fusion to outperform its rival, foldr/build, on many list computations, and enables performance-sensitive code to be expressed at a higher level of abstraction.},

We present a simple framework in this tradition, based on a Church-style effect-typing system for an ML-like language. The semantics of this language is formally defined by a series of monadic translations, each one expanding away a layer of effects. Such a layered specification is easy to reason about, but its direct implementation (whether by parameterized interpretation or by actual translation) is often prohibitively inefficient.By exploiting deeper semantic properties of monads, however, it is also possible to derive a vastly more efficient implementation: we show that each layer of effects can be uniformly simulated by continuation-passing, and further that multiple such layers can themselves be simulated by a standard semantics for call/cc and mutable state. Thus, even multi-effect programs can be executed in Scheme or SML/NJ at full native speed, generalizing an earlier single-effect result. As an example, we show how a simple resumption-based semantics of concurrency allows us to directly simulate a shared-state program across all possible dynamic interleavings of execution threads.},

Any effect-specific operations expressible in the monad are also given purely functional definitions, but these definitions are only directly executable in the context of an already translated program. This approach thus takes an inherently Church-style view of effects: the nominal meaning of every effectful term in the program depends crucially on its type. We present here a complementary, operational view of monadic effects, in which an effect definition directly induces an imperative behavior of the new operations expressible in the monad. This behavior is formalized as additional operational rules for only the new constructs; it does not require any structural changes to the evaluation judgment. Specifically, we give a small-step operational semantics of a prototypical functional language supporting programmer-definable, layered effects, and show how this semantics naturally supports reasoning by familiar syntactic techniques, such as showing soundness of a Curry-style effect-type system by the progress+preservation method.},

Over that period, there has been substantial incremental progress on several fronts within the ensuing research area, including denotational, operational, and axiomatic characterizations of effects; principles and frameworks for combining effects; prescriptive vs. descriptive effect-type systems; specification vs. implementation of effects; and realizations of effect-related theoretical constructions in practical functional languages, both eager and lazy. Yet few would confidently claim that programs with computational effects are by now as well understood, and as thoroughly supported by formal reasoning techniques, as types and terms in purely functional settings. This talk outlines (one view of) the landscape of effectful functional programming, and attempts to assess our collective progress towards the goal of a broad yet coherent theory of monadic effects. We are not quite there yet, but intriguingly, many potential ingredients of such a theory have been repeatedly discovered and developed, with only minor variations, in seemingly unrelated contexts. Some stronger-than-expected ties between the research topics mentioned above also instill hope that there is indeed a natural, comprehensive theory of monadic effects, waiting to be fully explicated.},

In our design, we rely on a rich ML-style module system to provide features such as visibility control and parameterization, while providing a minimal class mechanism that includes only those features needed to support inheritance. Programmers can then use the combination of modules and classes to implement the full range of class-based features and idioms. Our approach has the advantage that it provides a full-featured module system (useful in its own right), while keeping the class mechanism quite simple.We have incorporated this design in MOBY, which is an ML-style language that supports class-based object-oriented programming.

Moreover, the language for implementing compile-time macro transformers is usually the same as the language for implementing run-time functions. As a side effect of this sharing, implementations tend to allow the mingling of compile-time values and run-time values, as well as values from separate compilations. Such mingling breaks programming tools that must parse code without executing it. Macro implementors avoid harmful mingling by obeying certain macro-definition protocols and by inserting phase-distinguishing annotations into the code. However, the annotations are fragile, the protocols are not enforced, and programmers can only reason about the result in terms of the compiler's implementation. MzScheme---the language of the PLT Scheme tool suite---addresses the problem through a macro system that separates compilation without sacrificing the expressiveness of macros.},

Numerous papers explain their advantages, how the operators explain each other (or don't), and other aspects of the operators' existence. Production programming languages, however, do not support these operators, partly because their relationship to existing and demonstrably useful constructs - such as exceptions and dynamic binding - remains relatively unexplored. In this paper, we report on our effort of translating the theory of delimited and composable control into a viable implementation for a production system. The report shows how this effort involved a substantial design element, including work with a formal model, as well as significant practical exploration and engineering. The resulting version of PLT Scheme incorporates the expressive combination of delimited and composable control alongside dynamic-wind, dynamic binding, and exception handling. None of the additional operators subvert the intended benefits of existing control operators, so that programmers can freely mix and match control operators.},

We show that this technique can be used to encode any finite subtyping hierarchy (including hierarchies arising from multiple interface inheritance).

It also demonstrates the sensitivity of the relative expressiveness of user-defined effects to seemingly orthogonal language features.   We present three calculi, one per abstraction, extending Levy's call-by-push-value. For each calculus, we present syntax, operational semantics, a natural type-and-effect system, and, for effect handlers and monadic reflection, a set-theoretic denotational semantics. We establish their basic metatheoretic properties: safety, termination, and, where applicable, soundness and adequacy. Using Felleisen's notion of a macro translation, we show that these abstractions can macro-express each other, and show which translations preserve typeability. We use the adequate finitary set-theoretic denotational semantics for the monadic calculus to show that effect handlers cannot be macro-expressed while preserving typeability either by monadic reflection or by delimited control. Our argument fails with simple changes to the type system such as polymorphism and inductive types. We supplement our development with a mechanised Abella formalisation.},

  abstract = {Query formalisms and facilities have received significant attention in the past decades resulting in the development of query languages with varying characteristics; many of them resemble sql. Query facilities typically ship as part of database management systems or, sometimes, bundled with programming languages. For applications written in imperative programming languages, database management systems impose an expensive model transformation. In-memory data structures can represent sophisticated relationships in a manner that is efficient in terms of storage and processing overhead, but most general purpose programming languages lack an interpreter and/or an expressive query language for manipulating interactive queries. Issuing interactive ad-hoc queries on program data structures is tough. This work presents a method and an implementation for representing an application's arbitrary imperative programming data model as a queryable relational one. The Pico COllections Query Library (pico ql) uses a domain specific language to define a relational representation of application data structures and an sql interface implementation. Queries are issued interactively and are type safe. We demonstrate our relational representation for objects and the library's usefulness on three large c++ projects. pico ql enhances query expressiveness and boosts productivity compared to querying via traditional programming constructs.},

The reduction to inductive types is shown in a two-step process. First let T be a bifunctor contravariant in its first variable, convariant in the second. For each A it is possible to consider the convariant functor that sends X to TAX. If FA denotes a minimal invariant object of this covariant functor, one for each A, then F becomes a contrainvariant functor. It is shown that the minimal invariant objects of F are minimal invariant objects of the original bifunctor T. Secondly, let T be a contrainvariant functor. It is shown that the square of the functor (necessarily covariant) has the same minimal invariant objects.{$<$}{$>$}},

  abstract = {The main purpose of this paper is to take apart the reducibility method in order to understand how its pieces fit together, and in particular, to recast the conditions on candidates of reducibility as sheaf conditions. There has been a feeling among experts on this subject that it should be possible to present the reducibility method using more semantic means, and that a deeper understanding would then be gained. This paper gives mathematical substance to this feeling, by presenting a generalization of the reducibility method based on a semantic notion of realizability which uses the notion of a cover algebra (as in abstract sheaf theory). A key technical ingredient is the introduction of a new class of semantic structures equipped with preorders, called pre-applicative structures. These structures need not be extensional. In this framework, a general realizability theorem can be shown. Kleene's recursive realizability and a variant of Kreisel's modified realizability both fit into this framework. We are then able to prove a metatheorem which shows that if a property of realizers satisfies some simple conditions, then it holds for the semantic interpretations of all terms. Applying this theorem to the special case of the term model, yields a general theorem for proving properties of typed {$\lambda$}-terms, in particular, strong normalization and confluence. This approach clarifies the reducibility method by showing that the closure conditions on candidates of reducibility can be viewed as sheaf conditions. The above approach is applied to the simply-typed {$\lambda$}-calculus (with types \textrightarrow, \texttimes, +, and {$\perp$}), and to the second-order (polymorphic) {$\lambda$}-calculus (with types \textrightarrow{} and {$\forall$}2), for which it yields a new theorem.},

Expressing dependency via nesting, however, has two limitations: Abstractions that depend on more than one object cannot be modeled and a class must know all classes that depend on its objects. This paper presents dependent classes, a generalization of virtual classes that expresses similar semantics by parameterization rather than by nesting. This increases expressivity of class variations as well as the flexibility of their modularization. Besides, dependent classes complement multimethods in scenarios where multi-dispatched abstractions rather than multi-dispatched methods are needed. They can also be used to express more precise signatures of multimethods and even extend their dispatch semantics. We present a formal semantics of dependent classes and a machine-checked type soundness proof in Isabelle/HOL [29], the first of this kind for a language with virtual classes and path-dependent types.},

Compared to past delegation approaches, the novel aspect of our design is the ability to emulate the best aspects of inheritance while retaining maximum flexibility: using morphing, a class can select any of the methods of its delegatee and export them (if desired) or transform them (e.g., to add extra arguments or modify type signatures), yet without needing to name these methods explicitly and handle them one-by-one. Compared to past work on morphing, our approach adopts and adapts advanced delegation mechanisms, in order to add late binding capabilities and, thus, provide a full substitute of inheritance. Additionally, we explore complex semantic issues in the interaction of delegation with late binding. We present our language design both informally, with numerous examples, and formally in a core calculus.},

The main consequence is that the corresponding system is non-confluent.

Such transformations on typed ASTs are useful for code optimization in deeply embedded DSLs, for instance when using Lightweight Modular Staging (LMS). However, in Scala it is hard to make transformations for typed ASTs type-safe. Therefore, AST transformations in LMS are often not fully typechecked, preventing bugs from being caught early and without extensive testing. We show that writing type-safe transformations in such embeddings is in fact not just hard, but impossible without using unsafe casts or significantly restricting extensibility: Declaration-site variance opens GADTs representing typed ASTs not only to desirable extensions, but also to extensions that introduce exotic terms. We make the problem concrete on an embedding of {$\lambda{}<$}: through covariant GADTs. We discuss solution approaches, and sketch a Scala extension to address this problem without either introducing unsafe casts or restricting extensibility. We believe a complete solution would significantly ease writing transformations by allowing type-checking to verify them, and thus would ease their development.},

To prove CTS conversion correct, we extend the correctness proof of static differentiation from STLC to untyped {$\mathsl{\lambda}\lambda\backslash$}lambda -calculus via step-indexed logical relations, and prove sound the additional transformation via simulation theorems.To show ILC-based languages can improve performance relative to from-scratch recomputation, and that CTS conversion can extend its applicability, we perform an initial performance case study. We provide derivatives of primitives for operations on collections and incrementalize selected example programs using those primitives, confirming expected asymptotic speedups.},

In these lecture notes, we expand on the definition of datatype-generic programming, and present some examples of datatype-generic programs.

These invocations receive an ``half baked object'', i.e., an object whose derived class portion is uninitialized. Such a situation may lead to confusing semantics and to hidden coupling between the base and the derived. Dynamic binding within constructors also makes it difficult to enhance the programming language with advanced mechanisms for expressing design intent, such as non-null annotation (denoting reference values which can never be null), read-only annotation for fields and variables (expressing the intention that these cannot be modified after they are completely created) and class invariants (part of the famous design by contract methodology). A read-only field for example becomes immutable only after the creation of the enclosing object is complete.},

Together, these three techniques constitute Directed Automated Random Testing, or DART for short. The main strength of DART is thus that testing can be performed completely automatically on any program that compiles -- there is no need to write any test driver or harness code. During testing, DART detects standard errors such as program crashes, assertion violations, and non-termination. Preliminary experiments to unit test several examples of C programs are very encouraging.},

In some special cases, solutions are called unifiers. Other examples include Scott domain equations, unification grammars, type inference, and differential equations. The intuition that the composition of substitutions should be associative when defined, and should have identities, motivates a general concept of substitution system based on category theory. Notions of morphism, congruence, and quotient are given for substitution systems, each with the expected properties, and some general cardinality bounds are proved for most general solution sets (which are minimal sets of solutions with the property that any other solution is a substitution instance of one in the set). The notions of equation and solution are also generalized to systems of equations, i.e., to constraint solving, and applied t oclarify the notions of "compositionality" and "unification" in linguistic unification grammar. This paper is self-contained as regards category theory, and indeed, could be used as an introductory tutorial on that subject.}

However, this reduction does not take type information into account and gives no information about canonical forms for terms. We introduce a new operational semantics, which we call typed operational semantics, which defines a reduction to normal form for terms which are well-typed in the type theory. 
 
The central result of the thesis is soundness of the typed operational semantics for the original system. Completeness of the semantics is straightforward. We demonstrate that this equivalence between the declarative and operational presentations of type theory has important metatheoretic consequences: results such as strengthening, subject reduction and strong normalization follow by straightforward induction on derivations in the new system. 
 
We introduce these ideas in the setting of the simply typed lambda calculus. We then extend the techniques to Luo's system UTT, which is Martin-L{\"o}f's Logical Framework extended by a general mechanism for inductive types, a predicative universe and an impredicative universe of propositions. We also give a proof-irrelevant set-theoretic semantics for UTT.},

To meet these challenges, the Priority Programme 1593 Design for Future\textemdash{}Managed Software Evolution has been established, funded by the German Research Foundation, to develop fundamental methodologies and a focused approach for long-living software systems, maintaining high quality and supporting evolution during the whole life cycle. The goal of the priority programme is integrated and focused research in software engineering to develop methods for the continuous evolution of software and software/hardware systems for making systems adaptable to changing requirements and environments. For evaluation, we focus on two specific application domains: information systems and production systems in automation engineering. In particular two joint case studies from these application domains promote close collaborations among the individual projects of the priority programme. We consider several research topics that are of common interest, for instance co-evolution of models and implementation code, of models and tests, and among various types of models. Another research topic of common interest are run-time models to automatically synchronise software systems with their abstract models through continuous system monitoring. Both concepts, co-evolution and run-time models contribute to our vision to which we refer to as knowledge carrying software. We consider this as a major need for a long life of such software systems.},

In a number of popular systems, such as Coq and Isabelle, this automation is achieved primarily through tactics, which are programmed in a separate language from that of the prover's base logic. While tactics are clearly useful in practice, they can be difficult to maintain and compose because, unlike lemmas, their behavior cannot be specified within the expressive type system of the prover itself. We propose a novel approach to proof automation in Coq that allows the user to specify the behavior of custom automated routines in terms of Coq's own type system. Our approach involves a sophisticated application of Coq's canonical structures, which generalize Haskell type classes and facilitate a flexible style of dependently-typed logic programming. Specifically, just as Haskell type classes are used to infer the canonical implementation of an overloaded term at a given type, canonical structures can be used to infer the canonical proof of an overloaded lemma for a given instantiation of its parameters. We present a series of design patterns for canonical structure programming that enable one to carefully and predictably coax Coq's type inference engine into triggering the execution of user-supplied algorithms during unification, and we illustrate these patterns through several realistic examples drawn from Hoare Type Theory. We assume no prior knowledge of Coq and describe the relevant aspects of Coq type inference from first principles.},

  abstract = {Sequential effect systems are a class of effect system that exploits information about program order, rather than discarding it as traditional commutative effect systems do. This extra expressive power allows effect systems to reason about behavior over time, capturing properties such as atomicity, unstructured lock ownership, or even general safety properties. While we now understand the essential denotational (categorical) models fairly well, application of these ideas to real software is hampered by the sheer variety of source level control flow constructs in real languages. Denotational approaches are general enough to accommodate any particular control flow construct, but provide no guidance on the details, let alone applications. We address this new problem by appeal to a classic idea: macro-expression of commonly-used programming constructs in terms of control operators. We give an effect system for a subset of Racket's tagged delimited control operators, as a lifting of an effect system for a language without direct control operators. This gives the first account of sequential effects in the presence of general control operators. Using this system, we also re-derive the sequential effect system rules for control flow constructs previously shown sound directly, and derive sequential effect rules for new constructs not previously studied in the context of source-level sequential effect systems. This offers a way to directly extend source-level support for sequential effect systems to real programming languages.},

It achieves modular reasoning by partitioning the program state into thread-local and lock-protected parts, and assigning resource invariants to the latter. Surprisingly, the logic is unsound unless resource invariants are precise, i.e., unambiguously carve out an area of the heap. The counterexample showing the unsoundness involves the conjunction rule. However, to date it has been an open question whether concurrent separation logic without the conjunction rule is sound when the restriction on resource invariants is dropped: all the published proofs have the precision restriction baked in. In this paper we present a single proof that shows the soundness of the logic with imprecise resource invariants, but without the conjunction rule, as well as its classical version, where resource invariants are required to be precise and the conjunction rule is included. Our proof yields a precise and direct formulation of O'Hearn's Separation Property and provides a semantic analysis of the logic that is much more elementary than previous proofs.},

  abstract = {Increasing sharing in programs is desirable to compactify the code, and to avoid duplication of reduction work at run-time, thereby speeding up execution. We show how a maximal degree of sharing can be obtained for programs expressed as terms in the lambda calculus with letrec. We introduce a notion of `maximal compactness' for lambda-letrec-terms among all terms with the same infinite unfolding. Instead of defined purely syntactically, this notion is based on a graph semantics. lambda-letrec-terms are interpreted as first-order term graphs so that unfolding equivalence between terms is preserved and reflected through bisimilarity of the term graph interpretations. Compactness of the term graphs can then be compared via functional bisimulation. We describe practical and efficient methods for the following two problems: transforming a lambda-letrec-term into a maximally compact form; and deciding whether two lambda-letrec-terms are unfolding-equivalent. The transformation of a lambda-letrec-term \$L\$ into maximally compact form \$L\_0\$ proceeds in three steps: (i) translate L into its term graph \$G = [[ L ]]\$; (ii) compute the maximally shared form of \$G\$ as its bisimulation collapse \$G\_0\$; (iii) read back a lambda-letrec-term \$L\_0\$ from the term graph \$G\_0\$ with the property \$[[ L\_0 ]] = G\_0\$. This guarantees that \$L\_0\$ and \$L\$ have the same unfolding, and that \$L\_0\$ exhibits maximal sharing. The procedure for deciding whether two given lambda-letrec-terms \$L\_1\$ and \$L\_2\$ are unfolding-equivalent computes their term graph interpretations \$[[ L\_1 ]]\$ and \$[[ L\_2 ]]\$, and checks whether these term graphs are bisimilar. For illustration, we also provide a readily usable implementation.},

Object-orientation is instrumental in simplifying sequential programming, however, in a concurrent setting, programmers adding new methods in a subclass typically have to modify the code of the superclass, which inhibits reuse, a problem known as inheritance anomaly. There have been much efforts by researchers in the last two decades to solve the problem by deriving anomaly-free languages. Yet, these proposals have not ended up as practical solutions, thus one may ask why. In this article, we investigate from a theoretical perspective if a solution of the problem would introduce extra code complexity. We model object behavior as a regular language, and show that freedom from inheritance anomaly necessitates a language where ensuring Liskov-Wing substitutability becomes a language containment problem, which in our modeling is PSPACE hard. This indicates that we cannot expect programmers to manually ensure that subtyping holds in an anomaly-free language. Anomaly freedom thus predictably leads to software bugs and we doubt the value of providing it. From the practical perspective, the problem is already solved. Inheritance anomaly is part of the general fragile base class problem of object-oriented programming, that arises due to code coupling in implementation inheritance. In modern software practice, the fragile base class problem is circumvented by interface abstraction to avoid implementation inheritance, and opting for composition as means for reuse. We discuss concurrent programming issues with composition for reuse.},

This idea, guarded recursion, has proved useful in various contexts, from functional programming with infinite data structures to formulations of step-indexing internal to type theory. Categorical models have revealed that the later modality corresponds in essence to a simple reindexing of the discrete time scale. Unfortunately, existing guarded type theories suffer from significant limitations for programming purposes. These limitations stem from the fact that the later modality is not expressive enough to capture precise input-output dependencies of functions. As a consequence, guarded type theories reject many productive definitions. Combining insights from guarded type theories and synchronous programming languages, we propose a new modality for guarded recursion. This modality can apply any well-behaved reindexing of the time scale to a type. We call such reindexings time warps. Several modalities from the literature, including later, correspond to fixed time warps, and thus arise as special cases of ours.},

Therefore, it becomes important to organize data types systematically so that we can understand the relationship between one data type and another and investigate future directions which lead us to discover exciting new data types. There have been several approaches to systematically organize data types: algebraic specification methods using algebras, domain theory using complete partially ordered sets and type theory using the connection between logics and data types. Here, we use category theory. Category theory has proved to be remarkably good at revealing the nature of mathematical objects, and we use it to understand the true nature of data types in programming.}

This paper extends the characterisation to the case of more advanced datatypes: Generalised Algebraic Datatypes (GADTs) and Inductive Families. Specifically, we show that GADTs and Inductive Families are characterised as initial algebras of dependent polynomial functors. The theoretical tool we use throughout is an abstract notion of polynomial between sets together with its associated general form of polynomial functor between categories of indexed sets introduced by Gambino and Hyland. In the context of ADTs, this fundamental result is the basis for various generic functional programming techniques. To establish the usefulness of our approach for such developments in the broader context of inductively defined dependent types, we apply the theory to construct zippers for Inductive Families.},

  abstract = {Monitors constitute one of the common techniques to synchronize threads in multithreaded programs, where calling a {$\mathsf{w}\mathsf{a}\mathsf{i}\mathsf{t}$}wait\textbackslash{}mathsf \{wait\} command on a condition variable suspends the caller thread and notifying a condition variable causes the threads waiting for that condition variable to resume their execution. One potential problem with these programs is that a waiting thread might be suspended forever leading to deadlock, a state where each thread of the program is waiting for a condition variable or a lock. In this paper, a modular verification approach for deadlock-freedom of such programs is presented, ensuring that in any state of the execution of the program if there are some threads suspended then there exists at least one thread running. The main idea behind this approach is to make sure that for any condition variable v for which a thread is waiting there exists a thread obliged to fulfil an obligation for v that only waits for a waitable object whose wait level, an arbitrary number associated with each waitable object, is less than the wait level of v. The relaxed precedence relation introduced in this paper, aiming to avoid cycles, can also benefit some other verification approaches, verifying deadlock-freedom of other synchronization constructs such as channels and semaphores, enabling them to accept a wider range of deadlock-free programs. We encoded the proposed proof rules in the VeriFast program verifier and by defining some appropriate invariants for the locks associated with some condition variables succeeded in verifying some popular use cases of monitors including unbounded/bounded buffer, sleeping barber, barrier, and readers-writers locks. A soundness proof for the presented approach is provided; some of the trickiest lemmas in this proof have been machine-checked with Coq.},

  abstract = {The cost of reclaiming space with traversal-based garbage collection is inversely proportional to the amount of free memory, i.e., O(1/(1-f)), where f is the fraction of memory that is live. Consequently, the cost of garbage collection can be very high when the size of the live data remains large relative to the available free space. Intuitively, this is because allocating a small amount of memory space will require the garbage collector to traverse a significant fraction of the memory only to discover little garbage. This is unfortunate because in some application domains the size of the memory-resident data can be generally high. This can cause high GC overheads, especially when generational assumptions do not hold. One such application domain is self-adjusting computation, where computations use memory-resident execution traces in order to respond to changes to their state (e.g., inputs) efficiently. This paper proposes memory-management techniques for self-adjusting computation that remain efficient even when the size of the live data is large. More precisely, the proposed techniques guarantee O(1) amortized cost for each reclaimed memory object. We propose a set of primitives for self-adjusting computation that support the proposed memory management techniques. The primitives provide an operation for allocating memory; we reclaim unused memory automatically. We implement a library for supporting the primitives in the C language and perform an experimental evaluation. Our experiments show that the approach can be implemented with reasonably small constant-factor overheads and that the programs written using the library behave optimally. Compared to previous implementations, we measure up to an order of magnitude improvement in performance and up to a 75\% reduction in space usage.},

  abstract = {Many programming language techniques for incremental computation employ programmer-specified names for cached information. At runtime, each name identifies a "cache location" for a dynamic data value or a sub-computation; in sum, these cache location choices guide change propagation and incremental (re)execution. We call a cache location name precise when it identifies at most one value or subcomputation; we call all other names imprecise, or ambiguous. At a minimum, cache location names must be precise to ensure that change propagation works correctly; yet, reasoning statically about names in incremental programs remains an open problem. As a first step, this paper defines and solves the precise name problem, where we verify that incremental programs with explicit names use them precisely. To do so, we give a refinement type and effect system, and prove it sound (every well-typed program uses names precisely). We also demonstrate that this type system is expressive by verifying example programs that compute over efficient representations of incremental sequences and sets. Beyond verifying these programs, our type system also describes their dynamic naming strategies, e.g., for library documentation purposes.},

  abstract = {State-of-the-art programming language techniques for incremental computation employ programmer-specified names, whose role is critical for the asymptotic efficiency of many online algorithms. These names identify "cache locations" for dynamic data and sub-computations---the program's dynamic dependencies. To work well, or at all, these names must be precise, meaning that for an evaluation derivation in question, each name identifies at most one value or subcomputation; we call all other names imprecise, or ambiguous. The precise name problem consists of statically verifying that a program allocates names precisely, for all inputs. Past theoretical work ignores this problem by not permitting programs to use names directly, and past implementations, which necessarily permit explicit names, employ ad hoc workarounds for imprecise incremental programs. In this work, we give the first static verification approach to the precise naming problem. Specifically, we define a refinement type system that gives name term and index term sub-languages for approximating programmer-specified names of dynamic data and sub-computations. We prove that our type system enforces that these names are precise. We demonstrate the practical value of our proposed type system by verifying examples of incremental sequences and sets from a recent collections library, including both library client and implementation code. Drawing closer to an implementation of our type system, we derive a bidirectional version, and prove that it corresponds to our declarative type system. A key challenge in implementing the bidirectional system is handling constraints over names, name terms and name sets; toward this goal, we give decidable, syntactic rules to guide these checks.},

  abstract = {Nominal memoization combines memoized functional programming with a controlled form of imperative cache effects. By leveraging these imperative effects, nominal memoization can dramatically outperform traditional ("structural") memoization. However, the nominal memoization programming model is error-prone: when the programmer unintentionally misuses names, their incremental program ceases to correspond with a purely functional specification. This paper develops a refinement type system for nominal memoization that enforces a program's correspondence with a purely functional specification. Our type system employs set-indexed types in the style of DML (Xi and Pfenning 1999), extended with polymorphism over kinds and index functions. We prove that our type system enforces the dynamic side conditions proposed by Hammer et al 2015. Past work shows that these conditions suffice to write useful examples of nominal memoization while also guaranteeing from-scratch consistency of the incremental programs. These features contribute to its overall goal of expressing generic naming strategies in type-generic incremental code. In particular, we show various forms of namespace parametricity and illustrate through these examples its importance for expressing nominal memoization in library code. We also show how extensions to our type system can permit controlled forms of naming strategies that encode incremental churn and feedback. We speculate that certain feedback and churn patterns constitute naming strategies that encode existing forms of functional reactive computation as a mode of use of nominal memoization.},

The first goal of this talk is to discuss why the application of empirical methods is (still) relatively rare in PL research, and to discuss what could be done in empirical methods to make them a substantial part of PL research. The second goal is to speculate about the possible effects that concrete empirical knowledge could have had on the programming language community. For example, what would have happened to programming languages if current knowledge would have been available 30 years ago? What if knowledge about programming languages from the year 2050 would be available today?},

  abstract = {Standard ML is a useful programming language with a polymorphic type system and a flexible module facility. One notable feature of the core expression language of ML is that it is implicitly typed: no explicit type information need be supplied by the programmer. In contrast, the module language of ML is explicitly typed; in particular, the types of parameters in parametric modules must be supplied by the programmer. We study the type structure of Standard ML by giving an explicitly-typed, polymorphic function calculus that captures many of the essential aspects of both the core and module language. In this setting, implicitly-typed core language expressions are regarded as a convenient short-hand for an explicitly-typed counterpart in our function calculus. In contrast to the Girard-Reynolds polymorphic calculus, our function calculus is predicative: the type system may be built up by induction on type levels. We show that, in a precise sense, the language becomes inconsistent if restrictions imposed by type levels are relaxed. More specifically, we prove that the important programming features of ML cannot be added to any impredicative language, such as the Girard-Reynolds calculus, without implicitly assuming a type of all types.},

  abstract = {The design of a module system for constructing and maintaining large programs is a difficult task that raises a number of theoretical and practical issues. A fundamental issue is the management of the flow of information between program units at compile time via the notion of an interface. Experience has shown that fully opaque interfaces are awkward to use in practice since too much information is hidden, and that fully transparent interfaces lead to excessive interdependencies, creating problems for maintenance and separate compilation. The ``sharing'' specifications of Standard ML address this issue by allowing the programmer to specify equational relationships between types in separated modules, but are not expressive enough to allow the programmer complete control over the propagation of type information between modules.
These problems are addressed from a type-theoretic viewpoint by considering a calculus based on Girard's system F\&ohgr;. The calculus differs form those considered in previous studies by relying exclusively on a new form of weak sum type to propagate information at compile-time, in contrast to approaches based on strong sums which rely on substitution. The new form of sum type allows for the specification of equational, as well as type and kind, information in interfaces. This provides complete control over the propagation of compile-time information between program units and is sufficient to encode in a straightforward way most users of type sharing specifications in Standard ML.
Modules are treated as ``first-class'' citizens, and therefore the system supports higher-order modules and some object-oriented programming idioms; the language may be easily restricted to ``second-class'' modules found in ML-like languages.},

  abstract = {Traditional techniques for implementing polymorphism use a universal representation for objects of unknown type. Often, this forces a compiler to use universal representations even if the types of objects are known. We examine an alternative approach for compiling polymorphism where types are passed as arguments to polymorphic routines in order to determine the representation of an object. This approach allows monomorphic code to use natural, efficient representations, supports separate compilation of polymorphic definitions and, unlike coercion-based implementations of polymorphism, natural representations can be used for mutable objects such as refs and arrays.We are particularly interested in the typing properties of an intermediate language that allows run-time type  analysis to be coded within the language. This allows us to compile many representation transformations and many language features without adding new primitive operations to the language. In this paper, we provide a core target language where type-analysis operators can be coded within the language and the types of such operators can be accurately tracked. The target language is powerful enough to code a variety of useful features, yet type checking remains decidable. We show how to translate an ML-like language into the target language so that primitive operators can analyze types to produce efficient representations. We demonstrate the power of the ``user-level'' operators by coding flattened tuples, marshalling, type classes, and a form of type dynamic within the  language.},

  abstract = {The LF logical framework codifies a methodology for representing deductive systems, such as programming languages and logics, within a dependently typed {$\lambda$}-calculus. In this methodology, the syntactic and deductive apparatus of a system is encoded as the canonical forms of associated LF types; an encoding is correct (adequate) if and only if it defines a compositional bijection between the apparatus of the deductive system and the associated canonical forms. Given an adequate encoding, one may establish metatheoretic properties of a deductive system by reasoning about the associated LF representation. The Twelf implementation of the LF logical framework is a convenient and powerful tool for putting this methodology into practice. Twelf supports both the representation of a deductive system and the mechanical verification of proofs of metatheorems about it. The purpose of this article is to provide an up-to-date overview of the LF {$\lambda$}-calculus, the LF methodology for adequate representation, and the Twelf methodology for mechanizing metatheory. We begin by defining a variant of the original LF language, called Canonical LF, in which only canonical forms (long {$\beta\eta$}-normal forms) are permitted. This variant is parameterized by a subordination relation, which enables modular reasoning about LF representations. We then give an adequate representation of a simply typed {$\lambda$}-calculus in Canonical LF, both to illustrate adequacy and to serve as an object of analysis. Using this representation, we formalize and verify the proofs of some metatheoretic results, including preservation, determinacy, and strengthening. Each example illustrates a significant aspect of using LF and Twelf for formalized metatheory.},

We establish generic formal connections between operational semantics and equational theories. Formal properties of transformations for specific evaluation orders follow as corollaries.
Essentially, we factor transformations through Moggi's computational m
eta-language. Mapping \&lgr;-terms into the meta-language captures computation properties (e.g., partiality, strictness) and evaluation order explicitly in both the term and the type structure of the meta-language. The CPS transformation is then obtained by applying a generic transformation from terms and types in the meta-language to CPS terms and types, based on a typed term representation of the continuation monad. We prove an adequacy property for the generic transformation and establish an equational correspondence between the meta-language and CPS terms.
These generic results generalize Plotkin's seminal theorems, subsume more recent results, and enable new uses of CPS transformations and their inverses. We discuss how to aply these results to compilation.},

Hence, the Java program must have a finite and tractable state space. This work should be seen in a broader attempt to make formal methods applicable within NASA's areas such as space, aviation, and robotics.

  abstract = {We show how to efficiently evaluate generic map-filter-product queries, generalizations of select-project-join (SPJ) queries in relational algebra, based on a combination of two novel techniques: generic discrimination-based joins and lazy (formal) products. Discrimination-based joins are based on the notion of (equivalence) discriminator. A discriminator partitions a list of values according to a user-specified equivalence relation on keys the values are associated with. Equivalence relations can be specified in an expressive embedded language for denoting equivalence relations. We show that discriminators can be constructed generically (by structural recursion on equivalence expressions), purely functionally, and efficiently (worst-case linear time). The array-based basic multiset discrimination algorithm of Cai and Paige (1995) provides a base discriminator that is both asymptotically and practically efficient. In contrast to hashing, discrimination is fully abstract (only depends on which equivalences hold on its inputs), and in contrast to comparison-based sorting, it does not require an ordering relation on its inputs. In particular, it is applicable to references (pointers). Furthermore, it has better asymptotic computational complexity than both sorting and hashing. We represent cross-products and unions lazily (symbolically) as formal products of the argument sets (relations). This allows the selection operation to recognize on the fly whenever it is applied to a cross-product and invoke an efficient equijoin implementation. In particular, queries can still be formulated naively, using filter, map and product without an explicit join operation, yet garner the advantages of efficient join-algorithms during evaluation. The techniques subsume many of the optimization techniques based on relational algebra equalities, without need for a query preprocessing phase. They require no indexes and behave purely functionally. They can be considered a form of symbolic execution of set expressions that automate and encapsulate dynamic program transformation of such expressions and lead to asymptotic performance improvements over naive execution in many cases.},

  abstract = {Raising the level of abstraction is a key concern of software engineering, and libraries (either used directly or as a target of a program generation system) are a successful technique to raise programmer productivity and to improve software quality. Unfortunately successful libraries may contain functions that may not be general enough. For example, many numeric performance libraries contain functions that work on one- or higher-dimensional arrays. A problem arises if a program wants to invoke such a function on a non-contiguous subarray (e.g., in C the column of a matrix or a subarray of an image). If the library developer did not foresee this scenario, the client program must include explicit copy steps before and after the library function call, incurring a possibly high performance penalty. A better solution would be an enhanced library function that allows for the desired access pattern. Exposing the access pattern allows the compiler to optimize for the intended usage scenario(s). As we do not want the library developer to generate all interesting versions manually, we present a tool that takes a library function written in C and generates such a customized function for typical accesses. We describe the approach, discuss limitations, and report on the performance. As example access patterns we consider those most common in numerical applications: striding and block striding, general permutations, as well as scaling. We evaluate the tool on various library functions including filters, scans, reductions, sorting, FFTs, and linear algebra operations. The automatically generated custom version is in most cases significantly faster than using individual steps, offering speed-ups that are typically in the range of 1.2-1.8x.},

In Haskell types are assigned so-called kinds that distinguish between manifest types like the type of integers and functions on types like the list type constructor. Previous approaches to polytypic programming were restricted in that they only allowed to parameterize values by types of one fixed kind. In this paper, we show how to define values that are indexed by types of arbitrary kinds. It turns out that these polytypic values possess types that are indexed by kinds. We present several examples that demonstrate that the additional flexibility is useful in practice. One paradigmatic example is the mapping function, which describes the functorial action on arrows. A single polytypic definition yields mapping functions for data types of arbitrary kinds including first- and higher-order functors.

Haskell's type system essentially corresponds to the simply typed lambda calculus with kinds playing the role of types. We show that the specialization of a polytypic value to concrete instances of data types can be phrased as an interpretation of the simply typed lambda calculus. This allows us to employ logical relations to prove properties of polytypic values. Among other things, we show that the polytypic mapping function satisfies suitable generalizations of the functorial laws.},

  abstract = {A generic function is a function that can be instantiated on many data types to obtain data type specific functionality. Examples of generic functions are the functions that can be derived in Haskell, such as show, read, and `=='. The recent years have seen a number of proposals that support the definition of generic functions. Some of the proposals define new languages, some define extensions to existing languages. As a common characteristic none of the proposals can be made to work within Haskell 98: they all require something extra, either a more sophisticated type system or an additional language construct. The purpose of this paper is to show that one can, in fact, program generically within Haskell 98 obviating to some extent the need for fancy type systems or separate tools. Haskell's type classes are at the heart of this approach: they ensure that generic functions can be defined succinctly and, in particular, that they can be used painlessly. We detail three different implementations of generics both from a practical and from a theoretical perspective.},

The central idea of Generic Haskell is to interpret a type by a function, the so-called instance of a generic function at that type. Since types in Haskell include parametric types such as 'list of', Generic Haskell represents types by terms of the simply-typed lambda calculus. This paper puts the idea of interpreting types as functions on a firm theoretical footing, exploiting the fact that the simply-typed lambda calculus can be interpreted in a cartesian closed category. We identify a suitable target category, a subcategory of Cat, and argue that slice, coslice and comma categories are a good fit for interpreting generic functions at base types.},

This paper investigates the theoretical underpinnings of this transformation in the categorical setting of monads. We argue that so-called absolute Kan Extensions underlie this program optimisation. It is known that every Kan extension gives rise to a monad, the codensity monad, and furthermore that every monad is isomorphic to a codensity monad. The end formula for Kan extensions then induces an implementation of the monad, which can be seen as the categorical counterpart of continuation-passing style. We show that several optimisations are instances of this scheme: Church representations and implementation of backtracking using success and failure continuations, among others. Furthermore, we develop the calculational properties of Kan extensions, powers and ends. In particular, we propose a two-dimensional notation based on string diagrams that aims to support effective reasoning with Kan extensions.},

A general scheme is the hylomorphism, which captures the essence of divide-and-conquer: a problem is broken into sub-problems by a coalgebra; sub-problems are solved recursively; the sub-solutions are combined by an algebra to form a solution. In this paper we develop a simple toolbox for assembling recursive coalgebras, which by definition ensure that their hylo equations have unique solutions, whatever the algebra. Our main tool is the conjugate rule, a generic rule parametrized by an adjunction and a conjugate pair of natural transformations. We show that many basic adjunctions induce useful recursion schemes. In fact, almost every structured recursion scheme seems to arise as an instance of the conjugate rule. Further, we adapt our toolbox to the more expressive setting of parametrically recursive coalgebras, where the original input is also passed to the algebra. The formal development is complemented by a series of worked-out examples in Haskell.},

Our method can be applied in a wide variety of settings and uses only simple, elementary mathematics. In addition to various forms of indirect reference, the resulting models support powerful features such as impredicative quantification and equirecursion; moreover they are compatible with the kind of powerful substructural accounting required to model (higher-order) separation logic. In contrast to previous work, our model is easy to apply to new settings and has a simple axiomatization, which is complete in the sense that all models of it are isomorphic.

  abstract = {Theories of dependent types have been proposed as a foundation of constructive mathematics and as a framework in which to construct certified programs. In these applications an important role is played by identity types which internalise equality and therefore are essential for accommodating proofs and programs in the same formal system.

This thesis attempts to reconcile the two different ways that type theories deal with identity types. In extensional type theory the propositional equality induced by the identity types is identified with definitional equality, i.e. conversion. This renders type-checking and well-formedness of propositions undecidable and leads to non-termination in the presence of universes. In intensional type theory propositional equality is coarser than definitional equality, the latter being confined to definitional expansion and normalisation. Then type-checking and well-formedness are decidable, and this variant is therefore adopted by most implementations.

However, the identity type in intensional type theory is not powerful enough for formalisation of mathematics and program development. Notably, it does not identify pointwise equal functions (functional extensionality) and provides no means of redefining equality on a type as a given relation, i.e. quotient types. We call such capabilities extensional concepts. Other extensional concepts of interest are uniqueness of proofs and more specifically of equality proofs, subset types, and propositional extensionality---the identification of equivalent propositions. In this work we investigate to what extent these extensional concepts may be added to intensional type theory without sacrificing decidability and existence of canonical forms. The method we use is the translation of identity types into equivalence relations defined by induction on the type structure. In this way type theory with extensional concepts can be understood as a high-level language for working with equivalence relations instead of equality. Such translations of type theory into itself turn out to be best described using categorical models of type theory.

We thus begin with a thorough treatment of categorical models with particular emphasis on the interpretation of type-theoretic syntax in such models. We then show how pairs of types and predicates can be organised into a model of type theory in which subset types are available and in which any two proofs of a proposition are equal. This model has applications in the areas of program extraction from proofs and modules for functional programs. For us its main purpose is to clarify the idea of syntactic translations via categorical model constructions.

The main result of the thesis consists of the construction of two models in which functional extensionality and quotient types are available. In the first one types are modelled by types together with proposition-valued partial equivalence relations. This model is rather simple and in addition provides subset types and propositional extensionality. However, it does not furnish proper dependent types such as vectors or matrices. We try to overcome this disadvantage by using another model based on families of type-valued equivalence relations which is however much more complicated and validates certain conversion rules only up to propositional equality.

We illustrate the use of these models by several small examples taken from both formalised mathematics and program development.

We also establish various syntactic properties of propositional equality including a proof of the undecidability of typing in extensional type theory and a correspondence between derivations in extensional type theory and terms in intensional type theory with extensional concepts added. Furthermore we settle affirmatively the hitherto open question of the independence of unicity of equality proofs in intensional type theory which implies that the addition of pattern matching to intensional type theory does not yield a conservative extension.},

For example, in PolyP a pattern functor gives the structure of a data type viewed as a fixed point, and in Generic Haskell a structural representation type gives an isomorphic type view of a data type in terms of sums of products. Depending on this generic view on the structure of data types, some generic functions are easier, more difficult, or even impossible to define. Furthermore, the efficiency of some generic functions can be improved by choosing a different view. This paper introduces generic views on data types and shows why they are useful. Furthermore, it shows how generic views have been added to Generic Haskell, an extension of the functional programming language Haskell that supports the construction of generic functions. The separation between inductive definitions on type structure and generic views allows us to combine many approaches to generic programming in a single framework.},

Object-oriented programs place type-dependent behavior inside objects and invoke it via dynamic dispatch, while pattern-matching programs place type-dependent behavior outside data structures and invoke it via multiway conditionals (case statements). Grace is a new, dynamic, object-oriented language designed to support teaching: to this end, Grace needs to support both styles. We explain how this conflict can be resolved gracefully: by modelling patterns and cases as partial functions, reifying those functions as objects, and then building up complex patterns from simpler ones using pattern combinators. We describe the implementation of this design as an object-oriented framework, and a case study of its effectiveness.},

We propose incremental relational lenses, that equip relational lenses with change-propagating semantics that map small changes to the view to (potentially) small changes to the source tables. We also present a language-integrated implementation of relational lenses and a detailed experimental evaluation, showing orders of magnitude improvement over the non-incremental approach. Our work shows that relational lenses can be used to support expressive and efficient view updates at the language level, without relying on updatable view support from the underlying database.},

In this article, we propose a systematic and formal way for the construction of a list homomorphism for a given problem so that an efficient parallel program is derived. We show, with several well-known but nontrivial problems, how a straightforward, and ``obviously'' correct, but quite inefficient solution to the problem can be successfully turned into a semantically  equivalent ``almost list homomorphism.''

To remedy this situation, we propose a novel parallel skeleton, called accumulate, which not only efficiently describes data dependency in computation but also exhibits nice algebraic properties for manipulation. We show that this skeleton significantly eases skeletal parallel programming in practice, efficiently manipulating both regular and irregular data, and systematically optimizing skeletal parallel programs.},

To prove undecidability, we discover an equivalent definition of the \$D\_\{{$<$}:\}\$ subtyping rules in normal form.

After removing this rule, we discover two decidable fragments of \$D\_\{{$<$}:\}\$ subtyping and identify algorithms to decide them.

  abstract = {Certified programming is a framework in which any program is correct by construction. Proof assistants and dependently typed programming languages are the representatives of this paradigm where the proof and implementation of a program are done at the same time. However, it has some limitations: a program in Type Theory is built only with pure and total functions. Our objective is to write efficient and certified programs. The contributions of this work are the formalization, in the Simply Typed Lambda Calculus, of two mechanisms to achieve efficiency: to validate impure computations and to optimize computations by incrementality. An impure computation, that is a program with effects, and its validation in a functional and total language is done through a posteriori simulation. The simulation is performed afterwards on a monadic procedure and is guided by a prophecy. An efficient oracle is responsible for producing prophecies which is actually, the monadic procedure itself translated into an effectful programming language. The second contribution is an optimization to perform incremental computations. Incrementality as a way to propagate an input change into a corresponding output change is guided by formal change descriptions over terms and dynamic differentiation of functions. Displaceable types represent data-changes while an extension of the simply typed lambda calculus with differentials and partial derivatives offers a language to reason about incrementality.},

Two of the most prominent types of techniques to have emerged are *bisimulations* and *Kripke logical relations (KLRs)*. While both approaches are powerful, their complementary advantages have led us and other researchers to wonder whether there is an essential tradeoff between them. Furthermore, both approaches seem to suffer from fundamental limitations if one is interested in scaling them to inter-language reasoning. In this paper, we propose *relation transition systems (RTSs)*, which marry together some of the most appealing aspects of KLRs and bisimulations. In particular, RTSs show how bisimulations' support for reasoning about recursive features via *coinduction* can be synthesized with KLRs' support for reasoning about local state via *state transition systems*. Moreover, we have designed RTSs to avoid the limitations of KLRs and bisimulations that preclude their generalization to inter-language reasoning. Notably, unlike KLRs, RTSs are transitively composable.},

Pure subtype systems differ from traditional approaches to type theory (such as pure type systems) because the theory is based on subtyping, rather than typing. Proper types and typing are completely absent from the theory; the subtype relation is defined directly over objects. The traditional typing relation is shown to be a special case of subtyping, so the loss of types comes without any loss of generality. Pure subtype systems provide a uniform framework which seamlessly integrates subtyping with dependent and singleton types. The framework was designed as a theoretical foundation for several problems of practical interest, including mixin modules, virtual classes, and feature-oriented programming. The cost of using pure subtype systems is the complexity of the meta-theory. We formulate the subtype relation as an abstract reduction system, and show that the theory is sound if the underlying reductions commute. We are able to show that the reductions commute locally, but have thus far been unable to show that they commute globally. Although the proof is incomplete, it is ``close enough'' to rule out obvious counter-examples. We present it as an open problem in type theory.},

  abstract = {A practical type system for ML-style recursive modules should address at least two technical challenges. First, it needs to solve the double vision problem, which refers to an inconsistency between external and internal views of recursive modules. Second, it needs to overcome the tension between practical decidability and expressivity which arises from the potential presence of cyclic type definitions caused by recursion between modules. Although type systems in previous proposals solve the double vision problem and are also decidable, they fail to typecheck common patterns of recursive modules, such as functor fixpoints, that are essential to the expressivity of the module system and the modular development of recursive modules. This paper proposes a novel type system for recursive modules that solves the double vision problem and typechecks common patterns of recursive modules including functor fixpoints. First, we design a type system with a type equivalence based on weak bisimilarity, which does not lend itself to practical implementation in general, but accommodates a broad range of cyclic type definitions. Then, we identify a practically implementable fragment using a type equivalence based on type normalization, which is expressive enough to typecheck typical uses of recursive modules. Our approach is purely syntactic and the definition of the type system is ready for use in an actual implementation.},

  abstract = {Although theories of equivalence or subtyping for recursive types have been extensively investigated, sophisticated interaction between recursive types and abstract types has gained little attention. The key idea behind type theories for recursive types is to use syntactic contractiveness, meaning every {$\mu$}-bound variable occurs only under a type constructor such as \textrightarrow{} or {${_\ast}$}. This syntactic contractiveness guarantees the existence of the unique solution of recursive equations and thus has been considered necessary for designing a sound theory for recursive types. However, in an advanced type system, such as OCaml, with recursive types, type parameters, and abstract types, we cannot easily define the syntactic contractiveness of types. In this paper, we investigate a sound type system for recursive types, type parameters, and abstract types. In particular, we develop a new semantic notion of contractiveness for types and signatures using mixed induction and coinduction, and show that our type system is sound with respect to the standard call-by-value operational semantics, which eliminates signature sealings. Moreover we show that while non-contractive types in signatures lead to unsoundness of the type system, they may be allowed in modules. We have also formalized the whole system and its type soundness proof in Coq.},

We investigate the approach from the point of view of the logic BI of bunched implications of O'Hearnand Pym. We begin by giving a model in which the law of the excluded middleholds, thus showing that the approach is compatible with classical logic. The relationship between the intuitionistic and classical versions of the system is established by a translation, analogous to a translation from intuitionistic logic into the modal logic S4. We also consider the question of completeness of the axioms. BI's spatial implication is used to express weakest preconditions for object-component assignments, and an axiom for allocating a cons cell is shown to be complete under an interpretation of triplesthat allows a command to be applied to states with dangling pointers. We make this latter a feature, by incorporating an operation, and axiom, for disposing of memory. Finally, we describe a local character enjoyed by specifications in the logic, and show how this enables a class of frame axioms, which say what parts of the heap don't change, to be inferred automatically.},

In this work, we extend modal abstraction in the JMatch language to support static, modular reasoning about exhaustiveness and redundancy. New matching specifications allow these properties to be checked using an SMT solver. We also introduce expressive pattern-matching constructs. Our evaluation shows that these new features enable more concise code and that the performance of checking exhaustiveness and redundancy is acceptable.},

We use this model as a semantic foundation for computation and show that the "gap" between conventional irreversible computation and logically reversible computation can be captured by a type-and-effect system. Our type-and-effect system is structured as an arrow metalanguage that exposes creation and erasure of information as explicit effect operations. Irreversible computations arise from interactions with an implicit information environment, thus making them a derived notion, much like open systems in Physics. We sketch several applications which can benefit from an explicit treatment of information effects, such as quantitative information-flow security and differential privacy.},

Unification is used in type inference in many programming languages and in the execution of logic programs. This means that unification algorithms have to be written over and over again for different term types. Many other functions also make sense for a large class of datatypes; examples are pretty printers, equality checks, maps etc. They can be defined by induction on the structure of user-defined datatypes. Implementations of these functions for different datatypes are closely related to the structure of the datatypes. We call such functions polytypic. This paper describes a unification algorithm parametrised on the type of the terms, and shows how to use polytypism to obtain a unification algorithm that works for all regular term types.},

In this article we take Turi's approach in two new directions. Firstly, we show how to write operational semantics as modular components and how to combine such components to specify complete languages. Secondly, we show how the categorical nature of Turi's operational semantics makes it ideal for implementation in a functional programming language such as Haskell.},

  abstract = {Lambda-SF-calculus can represent programs as closed normal forms. In turn, all closed normal forms are data structures, in the sense that their internal structure is accessible through queries defined in the calculus, even to the point of constructing the Goedel number of a program. Thus, program analysis and optimisation can be performed entirely within the calculus, without requiring any meta-level process of quotation to produce a data structure.

Lambda-SF-calculus is a confluent, applicative rewriting system derived from lambda-calculus, and the combinatory SF-calculus. Its superior expressive power relative to lambda-calculus is demonstrated by the ability to decide if two programs are syntactically equal, or to determine if a program uses its input. Indeed, there is no homomorphism of applicative rewriting systems from lambda-SF-calculus to lambda-calculus.

Program analysis and optimisation can be illustrated by considering the conversion of a programs to combinators. Traditionally, a program p is interpreted using fixpoint constructions that do not have normal forms, but combinatory techniques can be used to block reduction until the program arguments are given. That is, p is interpreted by a closed normal form M. Then factorisation (by F) adapts the traditional account of lambda-abstraction in combinatory logic to convert M to a combinator N that is equivalent to M in the following two senses. First, N is extensionally equivalent to M where extensional equivalence is defined in terms of eta-reduction. Second, the conversion is an intensional equivalence in that it does not lose any information, and so can be reversed by another definable conversion. Further, the standard optimisations of the conversion process are all definable within lambda-SF-calculus, even those involving free variable analysis.

Proofs of all theorems in the paper have been verified using the Coq theorem prover.},

  abstract = {The definition of type equivalence is one of the most important design issues for any typed language. In dependently typed languages, because terms appear in types, this definition must rely on a definition of term equivalence. In that case, decidability of type checking requires decidability for the term equivalence relation. Almost all dependently-typed languages require this relation to be decidable. Some, such as Coq, Epigram or Agda, do so by employing analyses to force all programs to terminate. Conversely, others, such as DML, ATS, {$\Omega$}mega, or Haskell, allow nonterminating computation, but do not allow those terms to appear in types. Instead, they identify a terminating index language and use singleton types to connect indices to computation. In both cases, decidable type checking comes at a cost, in terms of complexity and expressiveness. Conversely, the benefits to be gained by decidable type checking are modest. Termination analyses allow dependently typed programs to verify total correctness properties. However, decidable type checking is not a prerequisite for type safety. Furthermore, decidability does not imply tractability. A decidable approximation of program equivalence may not be useful in practice. Therefore, we take a different approach: instead of a fixed notion for term equivalence, we parameterize our type system with an abstract relation that is not necessarily decidable. We then design a novel set of typing rules that require only weak properties of this abstract relation in the proof of the preservation and progress lemmas. This design provides flexibility: we compare valid instantiations of term equivalence which range from beta-equivalence, to contextual equivalence, to some exotic equivalences.},

Unfortunately, the standard parametricity theorem fails for nonstrict languages supporting a polymorphic strict evaluation primitive like Haskell's seq. Contrary to the folklore surrounding seq and parametricity, we show that not even quantifying only over strict and bottom-reflecting relations in the \$\textbackslash{}forall\$-clause of the underlying logical relation --- and thus restricting the choice of functions with which such relations are instantiated to obtain free theorems to strict and total ones --- is sufficient to recover from this failure. By addressing the subtle issues that arise when propagating up the type hierarchy restrictions imposed on a logical relation in order to accommodate the strictness primitive, we provide a parametricity theorem for the subset of Haskell corresponding to a Girard-Reynolds-style calculus with fixpoints, algebraic datatypes, and seq. A crucial ingredient of our approach is the use of an asymmetric logical relation, which leads to "inequational" versions of free theorems enriched by preconditions guaranteeing their validity in the described setting. Besides the potential to obtain corresponding preconditions for standard equational free theorems by combining some new inequational ones, the latter also have value in their own right, as is exemplified with a careful analysis of seq's impact on familiar program transformations.},

Current implementations of type class overloading are based on the use ofdictionary values, passed as extra parameters to overloaded functions. Unfortunately, this can have a significant effect on run-time performance, for example, by reducing the effectiveness of important program analyses and optimizations. This paper describes how a simple partial evaluator can be used to avoid the need for dictionary values at run-time by generating specialized versions of overloaded functions. This eliminates the run-time costs of overloading. Furthermore, and somewhat surprisingly given the presence of multiple versions of some functions, for all of the examples that we have tried so far, specialization actually leads to a reduction in the size of compiled programs.},

One of the main reasons for this is that it provides an elegant compromise between flexibility, allowing a single value to be used in different ways, and practicality, freeing the programmer from the need to supply explicit type information. Focusing on practical applications rather than implementation or theoretical details, these notes examine a range of extensions that provide more flexible type systems while retaining many of the properties that have made the original Hindley/Milner system so popular. The topics discussed, some old, but most quite recent, include higher-order polymorphism and type and constructor class overloading. Particular emphasis is placed on the use of these features to promote modularity and reusability.},

These intermediate languages are typically stratified, involving terms, types, and kinds. As the sophistication of the type system increases, these three levels begin to look more and more similar, so an attractive approach is to use a single syntax, and a single data type in the compiler, to represent all three. The theory of so-called pure type systems makes precisely such an identification. This paper describes Henk, a new typed intermediate language based closely on a particular pure type system, the lambda cube. On the way we give a tutorial introduction to the lambda cube. 1 Overview  Many compilers can be divided into three main stages.

  abstract = {Haskell's popularity has driven the need for ever more expressive type system features, most of which threaten the decidability and practicality of Damas-Milner type inference. One such feature is the ability to write functions with higher-rank types \textendash{} that is, functions that take polymorphic functions as their arguments. Complete type inference is known to be undecidable for higher-rank (impredicative) type systems, but in practice programmers are more than willing to add type annotations to guide the type inference engine, and to document their code. However, the choice of just what annotations are required, and what changes are required in the type system and its inference algorithm, has been an ongoing topic of research. We take as our starting point a {$\lambda$}-calculus proposed by Odersky and L{\"a}ufer. Their system supports arbitrary-rank polymorphism through the exploitation of type annotations on {$\lambda$}-bound arguments and arbitrary sub-terms. Though elegant, and more convenient than some other proposals, Odersky and L{\"a}ufer's system requires many annotations. We show how to use local type inference (invented by Pierce and Turner) to greatly reduce the annotation burden, to the point where higher-rank types become eminently usable. Higher-rank types have a very modest impact on type inference. We substantiate this claim in a very concrete way, by presenting a complete type-inference engine, written in Haskell, for a traditional Damas-Milner type system, and then showing how to extend it for higher-rank types. We write the type-inference engine using a monadic framework: it turns out to be a particularly compelling example of monads in action. The paper is long, but is strongly tutorial in style. Although we use Haskell as our example source language, and our implementation language, much of our work is directly applicable to any ML-like functional language.},

Several existing languages employ structural types in some form, including Modula-3, Scala and various extensions proposed for Java. However, formalising a recursive structural type system is challenging. In particular, the need to use structural coinduction remains a hindrance for many. We formalise in Agda a simple recursive and structural type system with products and unions. Agda proves useful here because it has explicit support for coinduction and will raise an error if this is misused. The implementation distinguishes between inductively and coinductively defined types: the former corresponds to a finite representation, such as found in source code or the internals of a compiler, while the latter corresponds to a mathematical ideal with which we can coinductively define relations and proofs that are easily applied back to the inductive interpretation. As an application of this, we provide a mechanised proof of subtyping soundness against a semantic embedding of the types into Agda.},

However, none of the logics that support both of these features reap the full potential of their combination. In particular, none of them provide general support for a feature we dub "higher-order ghost state": the ability to store arbitrary higher-order separation-logic predicates in ghost variables.   In this paper, we propose higher-order ghost state as a interesting and useful extension to CSL, which we formalize in the framework of Jung et al.'s recently developed Iris logic. To justify its soundness, we develop a novel algebraic structure called CMRAs ("cameras"), which can be thought of as "step-indexed partial commutative monoids". Finally, we show that Iris proofs utilizing higher-order ghost state can be effectively formalized in Coq, and discuss the challenges we faced in formalizing them.},

In this paper, we give the first formal (and machine-checked) safety proof for a language representing a realistic subset of Rust.

The result of the analysis is used to preserve only live data---a subset of reachable data---during garbage collection. The result is an increase in the garbage reclaimed and a reduction in the peak memory requirement of programs. While this technique has already been shown to yield benefits for eager first-order languages, the lack of a statically determinable execution order and the presence of closures pose new challenges for lazy languages. These require changes both in the liveness analysis itself and in the design of the garbage collector. To show the effectiveness of our method, we implemented a copying collector that uses the results of the liveness analysis to preserve live objects, both evaluated (i.e., in WHNF) and closures. Our experiments confirm that for programs running with a liveness-based garbage collector, there is a significant decrease in peak memory requirements. In addition, a sizable reduction in the number of collections ensures that in spite of using a more complex garbage collector, the execution times of programs running with liveness and reachability-based collectors remain comparable.},

Polymorphic variants can be used in order to introduce extensible algebraic datatypes into functional programming languages and are potentially useful for application domains such as interpreters, graphical user interface (GUI) libraries and database interfaces, where the number of necessary constructors cannot be determined in advance. Very few functional languages, however, have a mechanism to extend existing datatypes by adding new constructors. In general, for polymorphic variants to be useful, we would need some mechanisms to reuse existing functions and extend them for new constructors.Actually, the type system of Haskell, when extended with parametric type classes (or multi-parameter type classes with functional dependencies), has enough power not only to mimic polymorphic variants but also to extend existing functions for new constructors.This paper, first, explains how to do this in Haskell's type system (Haskell 98 with popular extensions). However, this encoding of polymorphic variants is difficult to use in practice. This is because it is quite tedious for programmers to write mimic codes by hand and because the problem of ambiguous overloading resolution would embarrass programmers. Therefore, the paper proposes an extension of Haskell's type classes that supports polymorphic variants directly. It has a novel form of instance declarations where records and variants are handled symmetrically.This type system can produce vanilla Haskell codes as a result of type inference. Therefore it behaves as a preprocessor which translates the extended language into plain Haskell. Programmers would be able to use polymorphic variants without worrying nasty problems such as ambiguities.},

Because modern systems are complex and non-deterministic, good experimental methodology demands that researchers account for uncertainty. To obtain valid results, they are expected to run many iterations of benchmarks, invoke virtual machines (VMs) several times, or even rebuild VM or benchmark binaries more than once. All this repetition costs time to complete experiments. Currently, many evaluations give up on sufficient repetition or rigorous statistical methods, or even run benchmarks only in training sizes. The results reported often lack proper variation estimates and, when a small difference between two systems is reported, some are simply unreliable. In contrast, we provide a statistically rigorous methodology for repetition and summarising results that makes efficient use of experimentation time. Time efficiency comes from two key observations. First, a given benchmark on a given platform is typically prone to much less non-determinism than the common worst-case of published corner-case studies. Second, repetition is most needed where most uncertainty arises (whether between builds, between executions or between iterations). We capture experimentation cost with a novel mathematical model, which we use to identify the number of repetitions at each level of an experiment necessary and sufficient to obtain a given level of precision. We present our methodology as a cookbook that guides researchers on the number of repetitions they should run to obtain reliable results. We also show how to present results with an effect size confidence interval. As an example, we show how to use our methodology to conduct throughput experiments with the DaCapo and SPEC CPU benchmarks on three recent platforms.},

We describe several examples of embedded languages. The first is a language for specifying simple pictures.

  abstract = {Plotkin and Pretnar's handlers for algebraic effects occupy a sweet spot in the design space of abstractions for effectful computation. By separating effect signatures from their implementation, algebraic effects provide a high degree of modularity, allowing programmers to express effectful programs independently of the concrete interpretation of their effects. A handler is an interpretation of the effects of an algebraic computation. The handler abstraction adapts well to multiple settings: pure or impure, strict or lazy, static types or dynamic types. This is a position paper whose main aim is to popularise the handler abstraction. We give a gentle introduction to its use, a collection of illustrative examples, and a straightforward operational semantics. We describe our Haskell implementation of handlers in detail, outline the ideas behind our OCaml, SML, and Racket implementations, and present experimental results comparing handlers with existing code.},

  abstract = {Major compiler verification efforts, such as the CompCert project, have traditionally simplified the verification problem by restricting attention to the correctness of whole-program compilation, leaving open the question of how to verify the correctness of separate compilation. Recently, a number of sophisticated techniques have been proposed for proving more flexible, compositional notions of compiler correctness, but these approaches tend to be quite heavyweight compared to the simple "closed simulations" used in verifying whole-program compilation. Applying such techniques to a compiler like CompCert, as Stewart et al. have done, involves major changes and extensions to its original verification. In this paper, we show that if we aim somewhat lower---to prove correctness of separate compilation, but only for a *single* compiler---we can drastically simplify the proof effort. Toward this end, we develop several lightweight techniques that recast the compositional verification problem in terms of whole-program compilation, thereby enabling us to largely reuse the closed-simulation proofs from existing compiler verifications. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these techniques by applying them to CompCert 2.4, converting its verification of whole-program compilation into a verification of separate compilation in less than two person-months. This conversion only required a small number of changes to the original proofs, and uncovered two compiler bugs along the way. The result is SepCompCert, the first verification of separate compilation for the full CompCert compiler.},

We step back and reflect on the feature-modularity discussion. We distinguish two notions of modularity, cohesion without interfaces and information hiding with interfaces, and point out the different expectations that, we believe, are the root of many heated discussions. We discuss whether feature interfaces should be desired and weigh their potential benefits and costs, specifically regarding crosscutting, granularity, feature interactions, and the distinction between closed-world and open-world reasoning. Because existing evidence for and against feature modularity and feature interfaces is shaky and inconclusive, more research is needed, for which we outline possible directions.},

The ILC is not only defined, but given a formal machine-understandable definition---accompanied by mechanically verifiable proofs of various properties, including in particular correctness of various sorts.

We present a contification transformation implemented by simple rewrites on the intermediate language. Exceptions are modelled using so-called 'double-barrelled' CPS. Subtyping on exception constructors then gives a very straightforward effect analysis for exceptions. We also show how a graph-based representation of CPS terms can be implemented extremely efficiently, with linear-time term simplification.},

We demonstrate that the addition of refinement types allows the integration of arbitrary solver-backed reasoning about logical propositions from external theories. By building on occurrence typing, we can add our enriched type system as an extension of Typed Racket---adding dependency and refinement reuses the existing formalism while increasing its expressiveness. Dependent refinement types allow Typed Racket programmers to express rich type relationships, ranging from data structure invariants such as red-black tree balance to preconditions such as vector bounds. Refinements allow programmers to embed the propositions that occurrence typing in Typed Racket already reasons about into their types. Further, extending occurrence typing to refinements allows us to make the underlying formalism simpler and more powerful. In addition to presenting the design of our system, we present a formal model of the system, show how to integrate it with theories over both linear arithmetic and bitvectors, and evaluate the system in the context of the full Typed Racket implementation. Specifically, we take safe vector access as a case study, and examine all vector accesses in a 56,000 line corpus of Typed Racket programs. Our system is able to prove that 50\% of these are safe with no new annotation, and with a few annotations and modifications, we can capture close to 80\%.},

The continuation exposed in freer monads can then be represented as an efficient type-aligned data structure. The end result is the algorithmically efficient extensible effects library, which is not only more comprehensible but also faster than earlier implementations. As an illustration of the new library, we show three surprisingly simple applications: non-determinism with committed choice (LogicT), catching IO exceptions in the presence of other effects, and the semi-automatic management of file handles and other resources through monadic regions.

Yet expressivity and performance are still lacking. For instance, the popular, well-optimized Java 8 streams do not support the zip operator and are still an order of magnitude slower than hand-written loops.   We present the first approach that represents the full generality of stream processing and eliminates overheads, via the use of staging. It is based on an unusually rich semantic model of stream interaction. We support any combination of zipping, nesting (or flat-mapping), sub-ranging, filtering, mapping\textemdash{}of finite or infinite streams. Our model captures idiosyncrasies that a programmer uses in optimizing stream pipelines, such as rate differences and the choice of a ``for'' vs. ``while'' loops. Our approach delivers hand-written\textendash{}like code, but automatically. It explicitly avoids the reliance on black-box optimizers and sufficiently-smart compilers, offering highest, guaranteed and portable performance.   Our approach relies on high-level concepts that are then readily mapped into an implementation. Accordingly, we have two distinct implementations: an OCaml stream library, staged via MetaOCaml, and a Scala library for the JVM, staged via LMS. In both cases, we derive libraries richer and simultaneously many tens of times faster than past work. We greatly exceed in performance the standard stream libraries available in Java, Scala and OCaml, including the well-optimized Java 8 streams.},

In effect, the results of the invariant computations are encoded as the compiled code for the late phase.This paper describes an alternative approach in which the results of early computations are encoded as a data structure, allowing both the early and late phases to be generated statically.

  abstract = {This paper discusses a new approach to the problem of dividing the text of a paragraph into lines of approximately equal length. Instead of simply making decisions one line at a time, the method considers the paragraph as a whole, so that the final appearance of a given line might be influenced by the text on succeeding lines. A system based on three simple primitive concepts called `boxes', `glue', and `penalties' provides the ability to deal satisfactorily with a wide variety of typesetting problems in a unified framework, using a single algorithm that determines optimum breakpoints. The algorithm avoids backtracking by a judicious use of the techniques of dynamic programming. Extensive computational experience confirms that the approach is both efficient and effective in producing high-quality output. The paper concludes with a brief history of line-breaking methods, and an appendix presents a simplified algorithm that requires comparatively few resources.},

  abstract = {This paper approaches the incremental view maintenance problem from an algebraic perspective. We construct the algebraic structure of a ring of databases and use it as the foundation of the design of a query calculus that allows to express powerful aggregate queries. The query calculus inherits key properties of the ring, such as having a normal form of polynomials and being closed under computing inverses and delta queries. The k-th delta of a polynomial query of degree k without nesting is purely a function of the update, not of the database. This gives rise to a method of eliminating expensive query operators such as joins from programs that perform incremental view maintenance. The main result is that, for non-nested queries, each individual aggregate value can be incrementally maintained using a constant amount of work. This is not possible for nonincremental evaluation.},

Such views have to be kept fresh at millisecond latencies. At the same time, these views have to support classical SQL, rather than window semantics, to enable applications that combine current with aged or historical data. In this article, we present the DBToaster system, which keeps materialized views of standard SQL queries continuously fresh as data changes very rapidly. This is achieved by a combination of aggressive compilation techniques and DBToaster's original recursive finite differencing technique which materializes a query and a set of its higher-order deltas as views. These views support each other's incremental maintenance, leading to a reduced overall view maintenance cost. DBToaster supports tens of thousands of complete view refreshes per second for a wide range of queries.},

  abstract = {Concurrent separation logics (CSLs) have come of age, and with age they have accumulated a great deal of complexity. Previous work on the Iris logic attempted to reduce the complex logical mechanisms of modern CSLs to two orthogonal concepts: partial commutative monoids (PCMs) and invariants. However, the realization of these concepts in Iris still bakes in several complex mechanisms\textemdash{}such as weakest preconditions and mask-changing view shifts\textemdash{}as primitive notions.In this paper, we take the Iris story to its (so to speak) logical conclusion, applying the reductionist methodology of Iris to Iris itself. Specifically, we define a small, resourceful base logic, which distills the essence of Iris: it comprises only the assertion layer of vanilla separation logic, plus a handful of simple modalities. We then show how the much fancier logical mechanisms of Iris\textemdash{}in particular, its entire program specification layer\textemdash{}can be understood as merely derived forms in our base logic. This approach helps to explain the meaning of Iris's program specifications at a much higher level of abstraction than was previously possible. We also show that the step-indexed ``later'' modality of Iris is an essential source of complexity, in that removing it leads to a logical inconsistency. All our results are fully formalized in the Coq proof assistant.},

This results in proofs that are at a too low level of abstraction because they are cluttered with bookkeeping code related to manipulating the object logic.   In this paper, we introduce a so-called proof mode that extends the Coq proof assistant with (spatial and non-spatial) named proof contexts for the object logic. We show that thanks to these contexts we can implement high-level tactics for introduction and elimination of the connectives of the object logic, and thereby make reasoning in the embedded logic as seamless as reasoning in the meta logic of the proof assistant. We apply our method to Iris: a state of the art higher-order impredicative concurrent separation logic.   We show that our method is very general, and is not just limited to program verification. We demonstrate its generality by formalizing correctness proofs of fine-grained concurrent algorithms, derived constructs of the Iris logic, and a unary and binary logical relation for a language with concurrency, higher-order store, polymorphism, and recursive types. This is the first formalization of a binary logical relation for such an expressive language. We also show how to use the logical relation to prove contextual refinement of fine-grained concurrent algorithms.},

One of the most advanced such tools is the Iris Proof Mode (IPM) for Coq, which offers a rich set of tactics for making separation-logic proofs look and feel like ordinary Coq proofs. However, IPM is tied to a particular separation logic (namely, Iris), thus limiting its applicability.   In this paper, we propose MoSeL, a general and extensible Coq framework that brings the benefits of IPM to a much larger class of separation logics. Unlike IPM, MoSeL is applicable to both affine and linear separation logics (and combinations thereof), and provides generic tactics that can be easily extended to account for the bespoke connectives of the logics with which it is instantiated. To demonstrate the effectiveness of MoSeL, we have instantiated it to provide effective tactical support for interactive and semi-automated proofs in six very different separation logics.},

Over time, these problems evolve so that the programmer must extend the toolkit or extend the types and adjust the existing tools accordingly. Ideally, this should be done without modifying existing code. Unfortunately, the prevailing program design strategies do not support both forms of extensibility: functional programming accommodates the addition of tools, while object-oriented programming supports either adding new tools or extending the data set, but not both. In this paper, we present a composite design pattern that synthesizes the best of both approaches and in the process resolves the tension between the two design strategies.

  abstract = {Most data analytics systems that require low-latency execution and efficient utilization of computing resources, increasingly adopt two computational paradigms, namely, incremental and approximate computing. Incremental computation updates the output incrementally instead of re-computing everything from scratch for successive runs of a job with input changes. Approximate computation returns an approximate output for a job instead of the exact output. Both paradigms rely on computing over a subset of data items instead of computing over the entire dataset, but they differ in their means for skipping parts of the computation. Incremental computing relies on the memoization of intermediate results of sub-computations, and reusing these memoized results across jobs for sub-computations that are unaffected by the changed input. Approximate computing relies on representative sampling of the entire dataset to compute over a subset of data items. In this thesis, we make the observation that these two computing paradigms are complementary, and can be married together! The high level idea is to: design a sampling algorithm that biases the sample selection to the memoized data items from previous runs. To concretize this idea, we designed an online stratified sampling algorithm that uses self-adjusting computation to produce an incrementally updated approximate output with bounded error. We implemented our algorithm in a data analytics system called IncAppox based on Apache Spark Streaming. Our evaluation of the system shows that IncApprox achieves the benefits of both incremental and approximate computing.},

We present a functional reactive programming language that statically bounds the size of the dataflow graph a reactive program creates, while still permitting use of higher-order functions and higher-type streams such as streams of streams. We achieve this with a novel linear type theory that both controls allocation and ensures that all recursive definitions are well-founded. We also give a denotational semantics for our language by combining recent work on metric spaces for the interpretation of higher-order causal functions with length-space models of space-bounded computation. The resulting category is doubly closed and hence forms a model of the logic of bunched implications.},

In addition to simplifying reasoning and eliminating whole classes of bugs, statically tracking effects opens the door to advanced compiler optimizations.     In this paper we present a relational model of a type-and-effect system for a higher-order, concurrent program- ming language. The model precisely captures the semantic invariants expressed by the effect annotations. We demonstrate that these invariants are strong enough to prove advanced program transformations, including automatic parallelization of expressions with suitably disjoint effects. The model also supports refinement proofs between abstract data types implementations with different internal data representations, including proofs that fine-grained concurrent algorithms refine their coarse-grained counterparts. This is the first model for such an expressive language that supports both effect-based optimizations and data abstraction.     The logical relation is defined in Iris, a state-of-the-art higher-order concurrent separation logic. This greatly simplifies proving well-definedness of the logical relation and also provides us with a powerful logic for reasoning in the model.},

  abstract = {Although most programming languages naturally share several language features, they are typically implemented as a monolithic product. Language features cannot be plugged and unplugged from a language and reused in another language. Some modular approaches to language construction do exist but composing language features requires a deep understanding of its implementation hampering their use. The choose and pick approach from software product lines provides an easy way to compose a language out of a set of language features. However, current approaches to language product lines are not sufficient enough to cope with the complexity and evolution of real world programming languages. In this work, we propose a general light-weight bottom-up approach to automatically extract a feature model from a set of tagged language components. We applied this approach to the Neverlang language development framework and developed the AiDE tool to guide language developers towards a valid language composition. The approach has been evaluated on a decomposed version of Javascript to highlight the benefits of such a language product line.},

The novelty of differential logical relations consists in measuring the distance between terms not (necessarily) by a numerical value, but by a mathematical object which somehow reflects the interactive complexity, i.e. the type, of the compared terms. We exemplify this concept in the simply-typed lambda-calculus, and show a form of soundness theorem. We also see how ordinary logical relations and metric relations can be seen as instances of differential logical relations. Finally, we show that differential logical relations can be organised in a cartesian closed category, contrarily to metric relations, which are well-known not to have such a structure, but only that of a monoidal closed category.},

However, inheritance has been generalized to the much more flexible notion originally proposed in Bracha's Jigsaw framework. That is, classes play also the role of modules, that can be composed by a rich set of operators, all of which can be expressed by a minimal core. We keep the nominal approach of Java-like languages, that is, types are class names. However, a class is not necessarily a structural subtype of any class used in its defining expression. The calculus allows the encoding of a large variety of different mechanisms for software composition in class-based languages, including standard inheritance, mixin classes, traits and hiding. Hence, FJig can be used as a unifying framework for analyzing existing mechanisms and proposing new extensions. We provide two different semantics of an FJig program: flattening and direct semantics. The difference is analogous to that between two intuitive models to understand inheritance: the former where inherited methods are copied into heir classes, and the latter where member lookup is performed by ascending the inheritance chain. Here we address equivalence of these two views for a more sophisticated composition mechanism.},

We propose a model, called RC11 (for Repaired C11), with a better semantics for SC accesses that restores the soundness of the compilation schemes to Power, maintains the DRF-SC guarantee, and provides stronger, more useful, guarantees to SC fences. In addition, we formally prove, for the first time, the correctness of the proposed stronger compilation schemes to Power that preserve load-to-store ordering and avoid "out-of-thin-air" reads.},

In contrast, Haskell's type classes support open, or extensible, functions that can be extended with new type-specific cases as new data types are defined. In this paper, we extend the 'Scrap your boilerplate' approach to support this open style. On the way, we demonstrate the desirability of abstraction over type classes, and the usefulness of recursive dictionarie.},

  abstract = {Executable Domain-Specific Modeling Languages (xDSMLs) are typically defined by metamodels that specify their abstract syntax, and model interpreters or compilers that define their execution semantics. To face the proliferation of xDSMLs in many domains, it is important to provide language engineering facilities for opportunistic reuse, extension, and customization of existing xDSMLs to ease the definition of new ones. Current approaches to language reuse either require to anticipate reuse, make use of advanced features that are not widely available in programming languages, or are not directly applicable to metamodel-based xDSMLs. In this paper, we propose a new language implementation pattern, named REVISITOR, that enables independent extensibility of the syntax and semantics of metamodel-based xDSMLs with incremental compilation and without anticipation. We seamlessly implement our approach alongside the compilation chain of the Eclipse Modeling Framework, thereby demonstrating that it is directly and broadly applicable in various modeling environments. We show how it can be employed to incrementally extend both the syntax and semantics of the fUML language without requiring anticipation or re-compilation of existing code, and with acceptable performance penalty compared to classical handmade visitors.},

But the cost of optimizing and generating code at run time can be prohibitive. We demonstrate how compile-time specialization can reduce the cost of run-time code generation by an order of magnitude without greatly affecting code quality. Several benchmark programs are examined, which exhibit an average cost of only six cycles per instruction generated at run time.},

Stratified polymorphism has an unproblematic set-theoretic semantics, and may lend itself to new approaches to type inference, without sacrificing useful expressive power. Our main technical result is that the functions representable in the finitely stratified polymorphic {$\lambda$}-calculus are precisely the super-elementary functions, i.e., the class {$\epsilon$}4 in Grzegorczyk's subrecursive hierarchy. This implies that there is no super-elementary bound on the length of optimal normalization sequences, and that the equality problem for finitely stratified polymorphic {$\lambda$}-expressions is not super-elementary. We also observe that finitely stratified polymorphism augmented with type recursion admits functional algorithms that are not typable in the full second order {$\lambda$}-calculus.},

By deferring aspects of compilation to run time, exact information about programs can be exploited, leading to greater opportunities for code improvement. This is in contrast to the use of static analyses, which are inherently conservative. Deferred compilation automates the translation of ordinary programs into native machine code that performs fast optimization and native-code generation at run time. Automation is obtained through the use of a compile-time staging analysis, which determines the portions of a program that may be safely and profitably compiled at run time. Fast run-time optimization is obtained by trading space for time: compile-time specialization yields numerous run-time code generators, each customized to optimize a small portion of the source program based on run-time information. Implementation strategies developed for a prototype compiler are discussed, and the results of preliminary experiments demonstrating significant overall speedup are presented.}

Our approach avoids the loss of precision associated with iterating individual analyses and the implementation difficulties of manually writing a super-analysis. The key to our approach is a novel method of implicit communication between the individual components of a super-analysis based on graph transformations. In this paper, we precisely define our approach; we demonstrate that it is sound and it terminates; finally we give experimental results showing that in practice (1) our framework produces results at least as precise as iterating the individual analyses while compiling at least 5 times faster, and (2) our framework achieves the same precision as a manually written super-analysis while incurring a compile-time overhead of less than 20\%.},

We have written a variety of forward and backward intraprocedural dataflow optimizations in Cobalt, including constant propagation and folding, branch folding, full and partial redundancy elimination, full and partial dead assignment elimination, and simple forms of points-to analysis. We implemented our soundness-checking strategy using the Simplify automatic theorem prover, and we have used this implementation to automatically prove our optimizations correct.

To explain call-by-observable, we first discuss general operational ideas, especially the distinction between values and computations, using the principle that ``a value is, a computation does''. Using an example program, we see that the lambda-calculus primitives can be understood as push/pop commands for an operand-stack. We provide operational and denotational semantics for a range of computational effects and show their agreement. We hence obtain semantics for call-by-name and call-by-value, of which some are familiar, some are new and some were known but previously appeared mysterious.},

We present its operational semantics in the form of a Felleisen-Friedman style CK-machine, and see how this machine suggests a new term judgement of stacks. When augmented with this judgement, CBPV has an elegant categorical semantics based on adjunctions.

We describe this categorical semantics incrementally. First, we introduce locally indexed categories and the opGrothendieck construction, and use these to give the basic structure for interpreting the 3 judgements: values, stacks and computations. Then we look at the universal property required to interpret each type constructor. We define a model to be a strong adjunction with countable coproducts, countable products and exponentials.

We justify this definition in two ways. First, we see that it has a wide range of instances: we give examples for divergence, storage, erratic choice, continuations etc., in each case decomposing Moggi's strong monad into a strong adjunction.

For the second justification, we start by giving equational laws for CBPV+stacks. This requires some additional pattern-matching constructs, but they do not affect the set of computations. We then show that the categories of theories and of models are equivalent.},

First, we have succeeded in designing a fully modular interpreter based on monad transformers that incudes features missing from Steele's, Espinosa's, and Wadler's earlier efforts. Second, we have found new ways to lift monad operations through monad transformers, in particular difficult cases not achieved in Moggi's original work. Third, we have demonstrated that interactions between features are reflected in liftings and that semantics can be changed by reordering monad transformers. Finally, we have implemented our interpreter in Gofer, whose constructor classes provide just the added power over Haskell's type classes to allow precise and convenient expression of our ideas. This implementation includes a method for constructing extensible unions and a form of subtyping that is interesting in its own right.},

  abstract = {Modern conflict-driven clause-learning (CDCL) Boolean SAT solvers provide efficient automatic analysis of real-world feature models (FM) of systems ranging from cars to operating systems. It is well-known that solver-based analysis of real-world FMs scale very well even though SAT instances obtained from such FMs are large, and the corresponding analysis problems are known to be NP-complete. To better understand why SAT solvers are so effective, we systematically studied many syntactic and semantic characteristics of a representative set of large real-world FMs. We discovered that a key reason why large real-world FMs are easy-to-analyze is that the vast majority of the variables in these models are unrestricted, i.e., the models are satisfiable for both true and false assignments to such variables under the current partial assignment. Given this discovery and our understanding of CDCL SAT solvers, we show that solvers can easily find satisfying assignments for such models without too many backtracks relative to the model size, explaining why solvers scale so well. Further analysis showed that the presence of unrestricted variables in these real-world models can be attributed to their high-degree of variability. Additionally, we experimented with a series of well-known non-backtracking simplifications that are particularly effective in solving FMs. The remaining variables/clauses after simplifications, called the core, are so few that they are easily solved even with backtracking, further strengthening our conclusions.},

  abstract = {A traditional philosophical controversy between representing general concepts as abstract sets or classes and representing concepts as concrete prototypes is reflected in a controversy between two mechanisms for sharing behavior between objects in object oriented programming languages. Inheritance splits the object world into classes, which encode behavior shared among a group of instances, which represent individual members of these sets. The class/instance distinction is not needed if the alternative of using prototypes is adopted. A prototype represents the default behavior for a concept, and new objects can re-use part of the knowledge stored in the prototype by saying how the new object differs from the prototype. The prototype approach seems to hold some advantages for representing default knowledge, and incrementally and dynamically modifying concepts. Delegation is the mechanism for implementing this in object oriented languages. After checking its idiosyncratic behavior, an object can forward a message to prototypes to invoke more general knowledge. Because class objects must be created before their instances can be used, and behavior can only be associated with classes, inheritance fixes the communication patterns between objects at instance creation time. Because any object can be used as a prototype, and any messages can be forwarded at any time, delegation is the more flexible and general of the two techniques.},

Programming in natural language might seem impossible, because it would appear to require complete natural language understanding and dealing with the vagueness of human descriptions of programs. Butwe think that several developments might nowmake programming in natural language feasible. First, improved broad coverage natural language parsers and semantic extraction techniques permit partial understanding. Second, mixed-initiative dialogues can be used for meaning disambiguation. And finally, where direct understanding techniques fail, we hope to fall back on Programming by Example, and other techniques for specifying the program in a more fail-soft manner. To assess the feasibility of this project, as a first step, we are studying how non-programming users describe programs in unconstrained natural language.We are exploring how to design dialogs that help the user make precise their intentions for the program, while constraining them as little as possible.

Effect handlers provide an abstraction for modular effectful programming: a handler acts as an interpreter for a collection of commands whose interfaces are statically tracked by the type system. However, Frank eliminates the need for an additional effect handling construct by generalising the basic mechanism of functional abstraction itself. A function is simply the special case of a Frank operator that interprets no commands. Moreover, Frank's operators can be multihandlers which simultaneously interpret commands from several sources at once, without disturbing the direct style of functional programming with values.   Effect typing in Frank employs a novel form of effect polymorphism which avoid mentioning effect variables in source code. This is achieved by propagating an ambient ability inwards, rather than accumulating unions of potential effects outwards.   We introduce Frank by example, and then give a formal account of the Frank type system and its semantics. We introduce Core Frank by elaborating Frank operators into functions, case expressions, and unary handlers, and then give a sound small-step operational semantics for Core Frank.   Programming with effects and handlers is in its infancy. We contribute an exploration of future possibilities, particularly in combination with other forms of rich type system.},

Such an algorithm provides a basis for a system integrating staged programming and partial evaluation because it allows programmers to switch between automatic and manual staging. Our algorithm is based on typing algorithm coupled with arithmetic-constraint solving. The algorithm decorates each subexpression of both a program and its type with numeric variables representing staging-annotations and then generates simple arithmetic constraints that describe the space of all possible stagings of the original program. Benefits of our approach include expressive BTA specifications in the form of stage-annotated types as well as support for polyvariance.},

  abstract = {Collectively, machine learning (ML) researchers are engaged in the creation and dissemination of knowledge about data-driven algorithms. In a given paper, researchers might aspire to any subset of the following goals, among others: to theoretically characterize what is learnable, to obtain understanding through empirically rigorous experiments, or to build a working system that has high predictive accuracy. While determining which knowledge warrants inquiry may be subjective, once the topic is fixed, papers are most valuable to the community when they act in service of the reader, creating foundational knowledge and communicating as clearly as possible. Recent progress in machine learning comes despite frequent departures from these ideals. In this paper, we focus on the following four patterns that appear to us to be trending in ML scholarship: (i) failure to distinguish between explanation and speculation; (ii) failure to identify the sources of empirical gains, e.g., emphasizing unnecessary modifications to neural architectures when gains actually stem from hyper-parameter tuning; (iii) mathiness: the use of mathematics that obfuscates or impresses rather than clarifies, e.g., by confusing technical and non-technical concepts; and (iv) misuse of language, e.g., by choosing terms of art with colloquial connotations or by overloading established technical terms. While the causes behind these patterns are uncertain, possibilities include the rapid expansion of the community, the consequent thinness of the reviewer pool, and the often-misaligned incentives between scholarship and short-term measures of success (e.g., bibliometrics, attention, and entrepreneurial opportunity). While each pattern offers a corresponding remedy (don't do it), we also discuss some speculative suggestions for how the community might combat these trends.},

Haskell's lazy semantics imposes a runtime model which is in general difficult to implement efficiently. GHC achieves good performance across a wide variety of programs via aggressive optimization taking advantage of the lack of side effects, and by targeting a carefully tuned virtual machine. The Intel Labs Haskell Research Compiler uses GHC as a frontend, but provides a new whole-program optimizing backend by compiling the GHC intermediate representation to a relatively generic functional language compilation platform. We found that GHC's external Core language was relatively easy to use, but reusing GHC's libraries and achieving full compatibility were harder. For certain classes of programs, our platform provides substantial performance benefits over GHC alone, performing 2x faster than GHC with the LLVM backend on selected modern performance-oriented benchmarks; for other classes of programs, the benefits of GHC's tuned virtual machine continue to outweigh the benefits of more aggressive whole program optimization. Overall we achieve parity with GHC with the LLVM backend. In this paper, we describe our Haskell compiler stack, its implementation and optimization approach, and present benchmark results comparing it to GHC.},

The method allows the queries to be written completely declaratively.

Most importantly, it defines and incrementally maintains invariants for not only the query results, but also all auxiliary values about the objects and sets involved, starting from the demand. Implementation and experiments with problems from a variety of application areas, including distributed algorithms, confirm the analyzed complexities, trade-offs, and significant improvements over prior works.},

In this case, we have a very good fit indeed between the typed language and the untyped realizability model \textemdash{} we refer to this condition as (constructive) logical full abstraction.

We give some examples of this situation for a variety of extensions of PCF. Of particular interest are some models that are logically fully abstract for typed languages including non-functional features.

Types, effects and regions are collectively called descriptions.
Expressions can be abstracted over any kind of description variable -- this permits type, effect and region polymorphism. Unobservable side-effects can be masked by the effect system; an effect soundness property guarantees that the effects computed statically by the effect system are a conservative approximation of the actual side-effects that a given expression may have.
The effect system we describe performs certain kinds of side-effect analysis that were not previously feasible. Experimental data from the programming language FX indicate that an effect system can be used effectively to compile programs for parallel computers.},

  abstract = {This paper discusses a problem of adequacy in formalization of mathematical notions in type theories. Based on a point of view that there should be a clear distinction between logical formulae and data types, we believe that, in an impredicative type theory like the calculus of constructions, arbitrary sets should be formalized as non-propositional types rather than propositional types which may be formed impredicatively.
We show that the calculus of constructions with type constants is a conservative extension of the intuitionistic higher-order logic, provided that the object set of the higher-order logic is interpreted as a non-propositional type constant. This result is proved by giving a formulae-as-types formulation of higher-order logic and using a projection technique developed by Berardi and Mohring. Comparing with the non-conservativity result of the (pure) calculus of constructions over higher-order logic [Ber89][Geu89], this provides an evidence to support the above view of adequate formalization and gives a better understanding of the formulae-as-types principle for higher-order logic.
We briefly discuss how abstract mathematics (e.g., abstract algebras) can be adequately formalized in an impredicative type theoy with predicative universes to support abstract reasoning.},

  abstract = {Incremental view maintenance is an essential tool for speeding up the processing of large, locally changing workloads. Its fundamental challenge is to ensure that changes are propagated from input to output more efficiently than via recomputation. We formalize this requirement for positive nested relational algebra (NRA+) on bags and we propose a transformation deriving deltas for any expression in the language. The main difficulty in maintaining nested queries lies in the inability to express within NRA+ the efficient updating of inner bags, i.e., without completely replacing the tuples that contain them. To address this problem, we first show how to efficiently incrementalize IncNRA+, a large fragment of NRA+ whose deltas never generate inner bag updates. We then provide a semantics-preserving transformation that takes any nested query into a collection of IncNRA+ queries. This constitutes the first static solution for the efficient incremental processing of languages with nested collections. Furthermore, we show that the state-of-the-art technique of recursive IVM, originally developed for positive relational algebra with aggregation, also extends to nested queries. Finally, we generalize our static approach for the efficient incrementalization of NRA+ to a family of simply-typed lambda calculi, given that its primitives are themselves efficiently incrementalizable.},

However, in general, monads proved difficult to compose and so research focused on special mechanisms for their composition such as distributive monads and monad transformers.We present a new approach to this problem which is general in that nearly all monads compose, mathematically elegant in using the standard categorical tools underpinning monads and computationally expressive in supporting a canonical recursion operator. In a nutshell, we propose that two monads should be composed by taking their coproduct. Although abstractly this is a simple idea, the actual construction of the coproduct of two monads is non-trivial. We outline this construction, show how to implement the coproduct within Haskell and demonstrate its usage with a few examples. We also discuss its relationship with other ways of combining monads, in particular distributive laws for monads and monad transformers.},

  abstract = {Writing any large program poses difficult problems of organization. In many modern programming languages these problems are addressed by special linguistic constructs, variously known as modules, packages, or clusters, which provide for partitioning programs into manageable components and for securely combining these components to form complete programs. Some general purpose components are able to take on a life of their own, being separately compiled and stored in libraries of generic, reusable program units. Usually modularity constructs also support some form of information hiding, such as "abstract data types." "Programming in the large" is concerned with using such constructs to impose structure on large programs, in contrast to "programming in the small", which deals with the detailed implementation of algorithms in terms of data structures and control constructs. Our goal here is to examine some of the proposed linguistic notions with respect to how they meet the pragmatic requirements of programming in the large.},

When it comes to complex systems, it also connotes predictable behavior, power, and creative functionality. Elegance is what separates the merely functional from the engaging. An elegant design usually has a thematic vision that drives its creation. It engages both designers and users and supports creative exploration on their part. The process of elegant design is an iterative, creative process that exploits systems thinking, probing questioning, and appropriate analogies and metaphors to gain insights that can be transformed novel solutions. This paper provides key insights into elegant systems design and characteristics of elegant systems designers.

The main part of the paper describes an original experiment to introduce a reflective architecture in an object-oriented language. It stresses the contributions of this language to the field of object-oriented programming and illustrates the new programming style made possible. The examples show that a lot of programming problems that were previously handled on an ad hoc basis, can in a reflective architecture be solved more elegantly.},

It has been used to great effect in Haskell libraries for manipulating byte arrays, Unicode text, and unboxed vectors. However, some operations, like vector append, still do not perform well within the standard stream fusion framework. Others, like SIMD computation using the SSE and AVX instructions available on modern x86 chips, do not seem to fit in the framework at all.  In this paper we introduce generalized stream fusion, which solves these issues. The key insight is to bundle together multiple stream representations, each tuned for a particular class of stream consumer. We also describe a stream representation suited for efficient computation with SSE instructions. Our ideas are implemented in modified versions of the GHC compiler and vector library. Benchmarks show that high-level Haskell code written using our compiler and libraries can produce code that is faster than both compiler- and hand-vectorized C.},

Our techniques center around a verified domain specific language for proving, tacRtac\textbackslash{}mathcal \{R\}\_\{tac\}, written in Gallina, Coq's logic. The design of tactics makes it easy to combine them into higher-level automation that can be proved sound in a mostly automated way. Furthermore, unlike traditional uses of reflection, tacRtac\textbackslash{}mathcal \{R\}\_\{tac\} tactics are independent of the underlying problem domain, which allows them to be re-tasked to automate new problems with very little effort. We demonstrate the usability of tacRtac\textbackslash{}mathcal \{R\}\_\{tac\} through several case studies demonstrating orders of magnitude speedups for relatively little engineering work.},

Using this result we show a scheme for implementing parametric higher-order contracts in an untyped setting which corresponds to a translation given by Sumii and Pierce. These contracts satisfy rich enough guarantees that we can extract analogues to Wadler's free theorems that rely on run-time enforcement of dynamic seals.},

Recent experimental extensions to the Haskell type class mechanism give us strong tools to
relativize types to other types. We may simulate some aspects of dependent typing by making
counterfeit type-level copies of data, with type constructors simulating data constructors and
type classes simulating datatypes. This paper gives examples of the technique and discusses

This paper shows how a dependent type can relate terms to the set of variables over which they are constructed. As a consequence, first-order unification becomes a structurally recursive program, and a termination proof is no longer required.

This operator, 'dissection', turns a container-like functor into a bifunctor representing a one-hole context in which elements to the left of the hole are distinguished in type from elements to its right. I present dissection here as a generic program, albeit for polynomial functors only. The notion is certainly applicable more widely, but here I prefer to concentrate on its diverse applications. For a start, map-like operations over the functor and fold-like operations over the recursive data structure it induces can be expressed by tail recursion alone. Further, the derivative is readily recovered from the dissection. Indeed, it is the dissection structure which delivers Huet's operations for navigating zippers. The original motivation for dissection was to define 'division', capturing the notion of leftmost hole, canonically distinguishing values with no elements from those with at least one. Division gives rise to an isomorphism corresponding to the remainder theorem in algebra. By way of a larger example, division and dissection are exploited to give a relatively efficient generic algorithm for abstracting all occurrences of one term from another in a first-order syntax. The source code for the paper is available online and compiles with recent extensions to the Glasgow Haskell Compiler.},

As programmers and reasoners, we need coinductive definitions in our toolbox, equipped with appropriate computational and logical machinery. Lazy functional languages like Haskell [18] exploit call-by-need computation to over-approximate the programming toolkit for coinductive data: in a sense, all data is coinductive and delivered on demand, or not at all if the programmer has failed to ensure the productivity of a program.},

The key is to reflect object language types as indices (however they may be constituted) for the term datatype in the host language, so that host type coincidence ensures object type coincidence. Whilst this technique is widespread for simply typed object languages, dependent types have proved a tougher nut with nontrivial computation in type equality. In their type-safe representations, Danielsson [2006] and Chapman [2009] succeed in capturing the equality rules, but at the cost of representing equality derivations explicitly within terms. This article constructs a type-safe representation for a dependently typed object language, dubbed KIPLING, whose computational type equality just appropriates that of its host, Agda. The KIPLING interpreter example is not merely de rigeur - it is key to the construction. At the heart of the technique is that key component of generic programming, the universe.},

GCminor neatly encapsulates the interface between mutator and collector code, while remaining simple and flexible enough to be used with a wide variety of source languages and collector styles. Front ends targeting GCminor can be implemented using any compiler technology and any desired degree of verification, including full semantics preservation, type preservation, or informal trust. As an example application of our framework, we describe a compiler for Haskell that translates the Glasgow Haskell Compiler's Core intermediate language to GCminor. To support a simple but useful memory safety argument for this compiler, the front end uses a novel combination of type preservation and runtime checks, which is of independent interest.},

Tablets appear unable to support capable (proficient) programming experiences because of their small form factor and touch-centric input method. This paper demonstrates how co-design of a programming language, YinYang, and its environment can overcome these challenges to enable do-it-yourself game creation on tablets. YinYang's programming model is based on tile and behavior constructs that simplify program structure for effective display and input on tablets, and also supports the definition and safe reuse of new abstractions to be competitive with capable programming languages. This paper details YinYang's design and evaluates our initial experience through a prototype that runs on current tablet hardware.},

We feel that better understanding of mathematical issues of formalization (e.g. names/namefree, intentional/extentional), and organization of formal development are the most useful areas to work on now for the long-term goal of formal mathematics. Finally, it is not so easy to understand the relationship between some informal mathematics and a claimed formalization of it. Are you satisfied with our definition of reduction? It might be more satisfying if we also defined de Bruijn terms and their reduction, and proved a correspondence between the two representations, but this only changes the degree of the problem, not its nature. What about the choice between the typing rules Lda and Lda'? There may be no ``right'' answer, as we may have different ideas in mind informally. There is no such thing as certain truth, and formalization does not change this state of affairs.},

Another tendency is to try to define merge techniques that are as general, accurate, scalable, and customizable as possible, so that they can be used in any phase in the software life-cycle and detect as many conflicts as possible.

Dependent types originated in the type theory of intuitionistic mathematics and have reappeared independently in programming languages such as CLU, Pebble, and Russell. Some of these languages make the assumption that there exists a \emph{type-of-all-types} which is its own type as well as the type of all other types. Girard proved that this approach is inconsistent from the perspective of intuitionistic logic. We apply Girard's techniques to establish that the type-of-all-types assumption creates serious pathologies from a programming perspective: a system using this assumption is inherently not normalizing, term equality is undecidable, and the resulting theory fails to be a conservative extension of the theory of the underlying base types. The failure of conservative extension means that classical reasoning about programs in such a system is not sound.},

Second, the language itself is reactive: it automatically tracks data dependencies and propagates updates along those dataflows. This allows developers to write reactive interfaces in a declarative and compositional style. Flapjax is built on top of JavaScript. It runs on unmodified browsers and readily interoperates with existing JavaScript code. It is usable as either a programming language (that is compiled to JavaScript) or as a JavaScript library, and is designed for both uses. This paper presents the language, its design decisions, and illustrative examples drawn from several working Flapjax applications.},

  abstract = {As more applications migrate to the cloud, and as "big data" edges into even more production environments, the performance and simplicity of exchanging data between compute nodes/devices is increasing in importance. An issue central to distributed programming, yet often under-considered, is serialization or pickling, i.e., persisting runtime objects by converting them into a binary or text representation. Pickler combinators are a popular approach from functional programming; their composability alleviates some of the tedium of writing pickling code by hand, but they don't translate well to object-oriented programming due to qualities like open class hierarchies and subtyping polymorphism. Furthermore, both functional pickler combinators and popular, Java-based serialization frameworks tend to be tied to a specific pickle format, leaving programmers with no choice of how their data is persisted. In this paper, we present object-oriented pickler combinators and a framework for generating them at compile-time, called scala/pickling, designed to be the default serialization mechanism of the Scala programming language. The static generation of OO picklers enables significant performance improvements, outperforming Java and Kryo in most of our benchmarks. In addition to high performance and the need for little to no boilerplate, our framework is extensible: using the type class pattern, users can provide both (1) custom, easily interchangeable pickle formats and (2) custom picklers, to override the default behavior of the pickling framework. In benchmarks, we compare scala/pickling with other popular industrial frameworks, and present results on time, memory usage, and size when pickling/unpickling a number of data types used in real-world, large-scale distributed applications and frameworks.},

This approach allows existing datatypes to be easily extended with both new operations and new variants, resolving a long-standing conflict between the functional and OO styles. However, previous designs based on this approach have been forced to give up modular typechecking, requiring whole-program checks to ensure type safety. We describe Extensible ML (eml), an ML-like language that supports hierarchical, extensible datatypes and functions while preserving purely modular typechecking. To achieve this result, eml's type system imposes a few requirements on datatype and function extensibility, but eml is still able to express both traditional functional and OO idioms. We have formalized a core version of eml and proven the associated type system sound, and we have developed a prototype interpreter for the language.},

With predicate dispatch, each method implementation includes a predicate guard specifying the conditions under which the method should be invoked, and logical implication of predicates determines the method overriding relation. Predicate dispatch naturally unifies and generalizes several common forms of dynamic dispatch, including traditional OO dispatch, multimethod dispatch, and functional-style pattern matching. Unfortunately, prior languages supporting predicate dispatch have had several deficiencies that limit the practical utility of this language feature. We describe JPred, a backward-compatible extension to Java supporting predicate dispatch. While prior languages with predicate dispatch have been extensions to toy or nonmainstream languages, we show how predicate dispatch can be naturally added to a traditional OO language. While prior languages with predicate dispatch have required the whole program to be available for typechecking and compilation, JPred retains Java's modular typechecking and compilation strategies. While prior languages with predicate dispatch have included special-purpose algorithms for reasoning about predicates, JPred employs general-purpose, off-the-shelf decision procedures. As a result, JPred's type system is more flexible, allowing several useful programming idioms that are spuriously rejected by those other languages. After describing the JPred language informally, we present an extension to Featherweight Java that formalizes the language and its modular type system, which we have proven sound. Finally, we discuss two case studies that illustrate the practical utility of JPred, including its use in the detection of several errors.},

Recent studies show that translating to typed target languages is a useful methodology for building compilers, because a compiler can use the types to implement efficient data representations, calling conventions, and tag-free garbage collection. Furthermore, type-based translations facilitate security and debugging through automatic type checking, as well as correctness arguments through the method of logical relations.We present closure conversion as a type-directed, and type-preserving translation for both the simply-typed and the polymorphic \textquestiondown{}-calculus. Our translations are based on a simple "closures as objects" principle: higher-order functions are viewed as objects consisting of a single method (the code) and a single instance variable (the environment). In the simply-typed case, the Pierce-Turner model of object typing where objects are packages of existential type suffices. In the polymorphic case, more careful tracking of type sharing is required. We exploit a variant of the Harper-Lillibridge "translucent type" formalism to characterize the types of polymorphic closures.},

A memo function remembers all the arguments to which it has been applied, together with their corresponding results, by storing them in a table. This table is consulted before each functional call to determine if the particular argument is in it. If so, the call is skipped and the stored result is returned; otherwise the call is performed and its result added to the table. Acar, Belloch and Harper present a framework to apply memoization selectively, that is, enabling the programmer to determine precisely the dependences between the input and the result of a function. This framework is efficient and yields programs whose performance can be analyzed using standard techniques. The language, implemented as an SML library, is based on a modal type system which allows the programmer to reveal the true data input/output dependences in a program. However, the modality seems to be an ad-hoc choice for the implementation. In this paper we develop selective memoization, using instead box types, corresponding to the necessitation modality {$\square$}. We also include non-memoized functions, and provide full proofs of type safeness and soundness of the dynamic semantics with respect to an effect-free system which is later translated into the very well-known language PCF.},

The typing rules guarantee that well-typed programs obey a phase distinction between erasable (compile-time) and non-erasable (run-time) terms. The erasability of an expression depends only on how its value is used in the rest of the program. Despite this simple observation, most languages treat erasability as an intrinsic property of expressions, leading to code duplication problems. Our approach overcomes this deficiency by treating erasability extrinsically. Because the execution model of EPTS generalizes the familiar notions of type erasure and parametric polymorphism, we believe functional programmers will find it quite natural to program in such a setting.},

The semantics of typed lambda calculus is usually described using Henkin models, consisting of functions over some collection of sets, or concrete cartesian closed categories, which are essentially equivalent. We describe a more general class of Kripke-style models. In categorical terms, our Kripke lambda models are cartesian closed subcategories of the presheaves over a poset. To those familiar with Kripke models of modal or intuitionistic logics, Kripke lambda models are likely to seem adequately `semantic'. However, when viewed as cartesian closed categories, they do not have the property variously referred to as concreteness, well- pointedness or having enough points. While the traditional lambda calculus proof system is not complete for Henkin models that may have empty types, we prove strong completeness for Kripke models. In fact, every set of equations that is closed under implication is the theory of a single Kripke model. We also develop some properties of logical relations over Kripke structures, showing that every theory is the theory of a model determined by a Kripke equivalence relation over a Henkin model. We discuss cartesian closed categories but present the main definitions and results without the use of category theory.},

This paper presents i3QL, a general-purpose programming language for specifying incremental computations. i3QL provides a declarative SQL-like syntax and is based on incremental versions of operators from relational algebra, enriched with support for general recursion. We integrated i3QL into Scala as a library, which enables programmers to use regular Scala code for non-incremental subcomputations of an i3QL query and to easily integrate incremental computations into larger software projects. To improve performance, i3QL optimizes user-defined queries by applying algebraic laws and partial evaluation. We describe the design and implementation of i3QL and its optimizations, demonstrate its applicability, and evaluate its performance.},

  title = {Scalable {{Automated Incrementalization}} for {{Real}}-{{Time Static Analyses}}},
  author = {Mitschke, Ralf},
  year = {2014},
  month = may,
  abstract = {This thesis proposes a framework for easy development of static analyses, whose results are incrementalized to provide instantaneous feedback in an integrated development environment (IDE).

Today, IDEs feature many tools that have static analyses as their foundation to assess software quality and catch correctness problems. 
Yet, these tools often fail to provide instantaneous feedback and are thus restricted to nightly build processes. This precludes developers from fixing issues at their inception time, i.e., when the problem and the developed solution are both still fresh in mind.

In order to provide instantaneous feedback, incrementalization is a well-known technique that utilizes the fact that developers make only small changes to the code and, hence, analysis results can be re-computed fast based on these changes. Yet, incrementalization requires carefully crafted static analyses. Thus, a manual approach to incrementalization is unattractive. Automated incrementalization can alleviate these problems and allows analyses writers to formulate their analyses as queries with the full data set in mind, without worrying over the semantics of incremental changes.

Existing approaches to automated incrementalization utilize standard technologies, such as deductive databases, that provide declarative query languages, yet also require to materialize the full dataset in main-memory, i.e., the memory is permanently blocked by the data required for the analyses. Other standard technologies such as relational databases offer better scalability due to persistence, yet require large transaction times for data. Both technologies are not a perfect match for integrating static analyses into an IDE, since the underlying data, i.e., the code base, is already persisted and managed by the IDE. Hence, transitioning the data into a database is redundant work.

In this thesis a novel approach is proposed that provides a declarative query language and automated incrementalization, yet retains in memory only a necessary minimum of data, i.e., only the data that is required for the incrementalization. The approach allows to declare static analyses as incrementally maintained views, where the underlying formalism for incrementalization is the relational algebra with extensions for object-orientation and recursion. The algebra allows to deduce which data is the necessary minimum for incremental maintenance and indeed shows that many views are self-maintainable, i.e., do not require to materialize memory at all. In addition an optimization for the algebra is proposed that allows to widen the range of self-maintainable views, based on domain knowledge of the underlying data. The optimization works similar to declaring primary keys for databases, i.e., the optimization is declared on the schema of the data, and defines which data is incrementally maintained in the same scope. The scope makes all analyses (views) that correlate only data within the boundaries of the scope self-maintainable.

The approach is implemented as an embedded domain specific language in a general-purpose programming language. The implementation can be understood as a database-like engine with an SQL-style query language and the execution semantics of the relational algebra. As such the system is a general purpose database-like query engine and can be used to incrementalize other domains than static analyses. To evaluate the approach a large variety of static analyses were sampled from real-world tools and formulated as incrementally maintained views in the implemented engine.},

  abstract = {In type theory, coinductive types are used to represent processes, and are thus crucial for the formal verification of non-terminating reactive programs in proof assistants based on type theory, such as Coq and Agda. Currently, programming and reasoning about coinductive types is difficult for two reasons: The need for recursive definitions to be productive, and the lack of coincidence of the built-in identity types and the important notion of bisimilarity. Guarded recursion in the sense of Nakano has recently been suggested as a possible approach to dealing with the problem of productivity, allowing this to be encoded in types. Indeed, coinductive types can be encoded using a combination of guarded recursion and universal quantification over clocks. This paper studies the notion of bisimilarity for guarded recursive types in Ticked Cubical Type Theory, an extension of Cubical Type Theory with guarded recursion. We prove that, for any functor, an abstract, category theoretic notion of bisimilarity for the final guarded coalgebra is equivalent (in the sense of homotopy type theory) to path equality (the primitive notion of equality in cubical type theory). As a worked example we study a guarded notion of labelled transition systems, and show that, as a special case of the general theorem, path equality coincides with an adaptation of the usual notion of bisimulation for processes. In particular, this implies that guarded recursion can be used to give simple equational reasoning proofs of bisimilarity. This work should be seen as a step towards obtaining bisimilarity as path equality for coinductive types using the encodings mentioned above.},

  abstract = {Just like any other branch of mathematics, denotational semantics of programming languages should be formalised in type theory, but adapting traditional domain theoretic semantics, as originally formulated in classical set theory to type theory has proven challenging. This paper is part of a project on formulating denotational semantics in type theories with guarded recursion. This should have the benefit of not only giving simpler semantics and proofs of properties such as adequacy, but also hopefully in the future to scale to languages with advanced features, such as general references, outside the reach of traditional domain theoretic techniques. Working in Guarded Dependent Type Theory (GDTT), we develop denotational semantics for FPC, the simply typed lambda calculus extended with recursive types, modelling the recursive types of FPC using the guarded recursive types of GDTT. We prove soundness and computational adequacy of the model in GDTT using a logical relation between syntax and semantics constructed also using guarded recursive types. The denotational semantics is intensional in the sense that it counts the number of unfold-fold reductions needed to compute the value of a term, but we construct a relation relating the denotations of extensionally equal terms, i.e., pairs of terms that compute the same value in a different number of steps. Finally we show how the denotational semantics of terms can be executed inside type theory and prove that executing the denotation of a boolean term computes the same value as the operational semantics of FPC.},

There has been a natural tendency to look to mathematics for a consistent, precise notion of what types are. The point of view there is extensional: a type is a subset of the universe of values. While this approach may have served its purpose quite adequately in mathematics, defining programming language types in this way ignores some vital ideas. Some interesting developments following the extensional approach are the ALGOL-68 type system [vW], Scott's theory [S], and Reynolds' system [R]. While each of these lend valuable insight to programming languages, I feel they miss an important aspect of types.Rather than worry about what types are I shall focus on the role of type checking. Type checking seems to serve two distinct purposes: authentication and secrecy. Both are useful when a programmer undertakes to implement a class of abstract objects to be used by many other programmers. He usually proceeds by choosing a representation for the objects in terms of other objects and then writes the required operations to manipulate them.},

But language and tool support for specification is lacking. Proof assistants can be used but bring their own difficulties, and a model produced in one, perhaps requiring many person-years effort and maintained over an extended period, cannot be used by those familiar with another. We introduce Lem, a language for engineering reusable large-scale semantic models. The Lem design takes inspiration both from functional programming languages and from proof assistants, and Lem definitions are translatable into OCaml for testing, Coq, HOL4, and Isabelle/HOL for proof, and LaTeX and HTML for presentation. This requires a delicate balance of expressiveness, careful library design, and implementation of transformations - akin to compilation, but subject to the constraint of producing usable and human-readable code for each target. Lem's effectiveness is demonstrated by its use in practice.},

  abstract = {Declarative queries enable programmers to write data manipulation code without being aware of the underlying data structure implementation. By increasing the level of abstraction over imperative code, they improve program readability and, crucially, create opportunities for automatic parallelization and optimization. For example, the Language Integrated Query (LINQ) extensions to C\# allow the same declarative query to process in-memory collections, and datasets that are distributed across a compute cluster. However, our experiments show that the serial performance of declarative code is several times slower than the equivalent hand-optimized code, because it is implemented using run-time abstractions---such as iterators---that incur overhead due to virtual function calls and superfluous instructions. To address this problem, we have developed Steno, which uses a combination of novel and well-known techniques to generate code for declarative queries that is almost as efficient as hand-optimized code. Steno translates a declarative LINQ query into type-specialized, inlined and loop-based imperative code. It eliminates chains of iterators from query execution, and optimizes nested queries. We have implemented Steno for uniprocessor, multiprocessor and distributed computing platforms, and show that, for a real-world distributed job, it can almost double the speed of end-to-end execution.},

  abstract = {This paper presents the insight that practical embedding techniques, commonly used for implementing Domain-Specific Languages, correspond to theoretical Normalisation-By-Evaluation (NBE) techniques, commonly used for deriving canonical form of terms with respect to an equational theory. NBE constitutes of four components: a syntactic domain, a semantic domain, and a pair of translations between the two. Embedding also often constitutes of four components: an object language, a host language, encoding of object terms in the host, and extraction of object code from the host. The correspondence is deep in that all four components in embedding and NBE correspond to each other. Based on this correspondence, this paper introduces Embedding-By-Normalisation (EBN) as a principled approach to study and structure embedding. The correspondence is useful in that solutions from NBE can be borrowed to solve problems in embedding. In particular, based on NBE techniques, such as Type-Directed Partial Evaluation, this paper presents a solution to the problem of extracting object code from embedded programs involving sum types, such as conditional expressions, and primitives, such as literals and operations on them.},

QDSLs reuse facilities provided for the host language, since host and quoted terms share the same syntax, type system, and normalisation rules. QDSL terms are normalised to a canonical form, inspired by the subformula principle, which guarantees that one can use higher-order types in the source while guaranteeing first-order types in the target, and enables using types to guide fusion. We test our ideas by re-implementing Feldspar, which was originally implemented as an Embedded DSL (EDSL), as a QDSL; and we compare the QDSL and EDSL variants. The two variants produce identical code.},

Yet ML prohibits recursion between modules. As a result of this constraint, the programmer may have to consolidate conceptually separate components into a single module, intruding on modular programming. Introducing recursive modules is a natural way out of this predicament. Existing proposals, however, vary in expressiveness and verbosity. In this paper, we propose a type system for recursive modules, which can infer their signatures. Opaque signatures can also be given explicitly, to provide type abstraction either inside or outside the recursion. The type system is decidable, and is sound for a call-by-value semantics. We also present a solution to the expression problem, in support of our design choices.},

  abstract = {Data representation migration is a program transformation that involves changing the type of a particular data structure, and then updating all of the operations that somehow depend on that data structure according to the new type. Changing the data representation can provide benefits such as improving efficiency and improving the quality of the computed results. Performing such a transformation is challenging, because it requires applying data-type specific changes to code fragments that may be widely scattered throughout the source code, connected by dataflow dependencies. Refactoring systems are typically sensitive to dataflow dependencies, but are not programmable with respect to the features of particular data types. Existing program transformation languages provide the needed flexibility, but do not concisely support reasoning about dataflow dependencies. To address the needs of data representation migration, we propose a new approach to program transformation that relies on a notion of semantic dependency: every transformation step propagates the transformation process onward to code that somehow depends on the transformed code. Our approach provides a declarative transformation-specification language, for expressing typespecific transformation rules. We further provide scoped rules, a mechanism for guiding rule application, and tags, a device for simple program analysis within our framework, to enable more powerful program transformations. We have implemented a prototype transformation system based on these ideas for C and C++ code and evaluate it against three example specifications, including vectorization, transformation of integers to big integers, and transformation of array-of-structures data types to structure-of-arrays format. Our evaluation shows that our approach can improve program performance and the precision of the computed results, and that it scales to programs of up to 3700 lines.},

  abstract = {Compiler verification is essential for the construction of fully verified software, but most prior work (such as CompCert) has focused on verifying whole-program compilers. To support separate compilation and to enable linking of results from different verified compilers, it is important to develop a compositional notion of compiler correctness that is modular (preserved under linking), transitive (supports multi-pass compilation), and flexible (applicable to compilers that use different intermediate languages or employ non-standard program transformations). In this paper, building on prior work of Hur et al., we develop a novel approach to compositional compiler verification based on parametric inter-language simulations (PILS). PILS are modular: they enable compiler verification in a manner that supports separate compilation. PILS are transitive: we use them to verify Pilsner, a simple (but non-trivial) multi-pass optimizing compiler (programmed in Coq) from an ML-like source language S to an assembly-like target language T, going through a CPS-based intermediate language. Pilsner is the first multi-pass compiler for a higher-order imperative language to be compositionally verified. Lastly, PILS are flexible: we use them to additionally verify (1) Zwickel, a direct non-optimizing compiler for S, and (2) a hand-coded self-modifying T module, proven correct w.r.t. an S-level specification. The output of Zwickel and the self-modifying T module can then be safely linked together with the output of Pilsner. All together, this has been a significant undertaking, involving several person-years of work and over 55,000 lines of Coq.},

  abstract = {We present a new approach to automated reasoning about higher-order programs by endowing symbolic execution with a notion of higher-order, symbolic values. Our approach is sound and relatively complete with respect to a first-order solver for base type values. Therefore, it can form the basis of automated verification and bug-finding tools for higher-order programs. To validate our approach, we use it to develop and evaluate a system for verifying and refuting behavioral software contracts of components in a functional language, which we call soft contract verification. In doing so, we discover a mutually beneficial relation between behavioral contracts and higher-order symbolic execution. Our system uses higher-order symbolic execution, leveraging contracts as a source of symbolic values including unknown behavioral values, and employs an updatable heap of contract invariants to reason about flow-sensitive facts. Whenever a contract is refuted, it reports a concrete counterexample reproducing the error, which may involve solving for an unknown function. The approach is able to analyze first-class contracts, recursive data structures, unknown functions, and control-flow-sensitive refinements of values, which are all idiomatic in dynamic languages. It makes effective use of an off-the-shelf solver to decide problems without heavy encodings. The approach is competitive with a wide range of existing tools---including type systems, flow analyzers, and model checkers---on their own benchmarks. We have built a tool which analyzes programs written in Racket, and report on its effectiveness in verifying and refuting contracts.},

  abstract = {Dependent type theories have a long history of being used for theorem proving. One aspect of type theory which makes it very powerful as a proof language is that it mixes deduction with computation. This also makes type theory a good candidate for programming---the strength of the type system allows properties of programs to be stated and established, and the computational properties provide semantics for the programs.

This thesis is concerned with bridging the gap between the theoretical presentations of type theory and the requirements on a practical programming language. Although there are many challenging research problems left to solve before we have an industrial scale programming language based on type theory, this thesis takes us a good step along the way.

In functional programming languages pattern matching provides a concise notation for defining functions. In dependent type theory, pattern matching becomes even more powerful, in that inspecting the value of a particular term can reveal information about the types and values of other terms. In this thesis we give a type checking algorithm for definitions by pattern matching in type theory, supporting overlapping patterns, and pattern matching on intermediate results using the with rule.

Traditional presentations of type theory suffers from rather verbose notation, cluttering programs and proofs with, for instance, explicit type information. One solution to this problem is to allow terms that can be inferred automatically to be omitted. This is usually implemented by inserting metavariables in place of the omitted terms and using unification to solve these metavariables during type checking. We present a type checking algorithm for a theory with metavariables and prove its soundness independent of whether the metavariables are solved or not.

In any programming language it is important to be able to structure large programs into separate units or modules and limit the interaction between these modules. In this thesis we present a simple, but powerful module system for a dependently typed language. The main focus of the module system is to manage the name space of a program, and an important characteristic is a clear separation between the module system and the type checker, making it largely independent of the underlying language.

As a side track, not directly related to the use of type theory for programming, we present a connection between type theory and a first-order logic theorem prover. This connection saves the user the burden of proving simple, but tedious first-order theorems by leaving them for the prover. We use a transparent translation to first-order logic which makes the proofs constructed by the theorem prover human readable. The soundness of the connection is established by a general metatheorem.

Finally we put our work into practise in the implementation of a programming language, Agda, based on type theory. As an illustrating example we show how to program a simple certfied prover for equations in a commutative monoid, which can be used internally in Agda. Much more impressive examples have been done by others, showing that the ideas developed in this thesis are viable in practise.},

This idea is formalized mathematically in Reynolds{\^a}s theory of relational parametricity, which allows the metatheoretical derivation of parametricity theorems about all values of a given type. Although predicative System F embeds into dependent type systems such as Martin-L{\~A}\textparagraph{}f Type Theory (MLTT), parametricity does not carry over as easily. The identity extension lemma, which is crucial if we want to prove theorems involving equality, has only been shown to hold for small types, excluding the universe. We attribute this to the fact that MLTT uses a single type former {\^I} to generalize both the parametric quantifier {\^a} and the type former {\^a} which is non-parametric in the sense that its elements may use their argument as a value. We equip MLTT with parametric quantifiers {\^a} and {\^a} alongside the existing {\^I} and {\^I}\textsterling, and provide relation type formers for proving parametricity theorems internally. We show internally the existence of initial algebras and final co-algebras of indexed functors both by Church encoding and, for a large class of functors, by using sized types. We prove soundness of our type system by enhancing existing iterated reflexive graph (cubical set) models of dependently typed parametricity by distinguishing between edges that express relatedness of objects (bridges) and edges that express equality (paths). The parametric functions are those that map bridges to paths. We implement an extension to the Agda proof assistant that type-checks proofs in our type system.},

On the other hand, the monoidal natural transformations on functors can be generalized to work on a category of more specific coalgebras. This generalization turns out to be the type of compos from the Compos generic programming library. A theorem, originally conjectured by van Laarhoven, proves that these two generalizations are isomorphic, thus the core data types of the Uniplate and Compos libraries supporting generic program on single recursive types are the same. Both the Uniplate and Compos libraries generalize this core functionality to support mutually recursive types in different ways. This paper proposes a third extension to support mutually recursive data types that is as powerful as Compos and as easy to use as Uniplate.

The type system can model the essential concepts of JAVA's inner classes as well as virtual types and family polymorphism found in BETA or GBETA. It can also model most concepts of SML-style module systems, including sharing constraints and higher-order functors, but excluding applicative functors. The type system can thus be used as a basis for unifying concepts that so far existed in parallel in advanced object systems and in module systems. The paper presents results on confluence of the calculus, soundness of the type system, and undecidability of type checking.},

  abstract = {Program generators for high performance libraries are an appealing solution to the recurring problem of porting and optimizing code with every new processor generation, but only few such generators exist to date. This is due to not only the difficulty of the design, but also of the actual implementation, which often results in an ad-hoc collection of standalone programs and scripts that are hard to extend, maintain, or reuse. In this paper we ask whether and which programming language concepts and features are needed to enable a more systematic construction of such generators. The systematic approach we advocate extrapolates from existing generators: a) describing the problem and algorithmic knowledge using one, or several, domain-specific languages (DSLs), b) expressing optimizations and choices as rewrite rules on DSL programs, c) designing data structures that can be configured to control the type of code that is generated and the data representation used, and d) using autotuning to select the best-performing alternative. As a case study, we implement a small, but representative subset of Spiral in Scala using the Lightweight Modular Staging (LMS) framework. The first main contribution of this paper is the realization of c) using type classes to abstract over staging decisions, i.e. which pieces of a computation are performed immediately and for which pieces code is generated. Specifically, we abstract over different complex data representations jointly with different code representations including generating loops versus unrolled code with scalar replacement - a crucial and usually tedious performance transformation. The second main contribution is to provide full support for a) and d) within the LMS framework: we extend LMS to support translation between different DSLs and autotuning through search.},

The intuitive basis for our proposal is the following analogy: a non-local procedure is independent of locally-declared variables in the same way that a parametrically polymorphic function is independent of types to which it is instantiated.A connection between parametricity and representational abstraction was first suggested by J.C. Reynolds. Reynolds used logical relations to formalize this connection in languages with type variables and user-defined types. We use relational parametricity to construct a model for an Algol-like language in which interactions between local and non-local entities satisfy certain relational criteria.  Reasoning about local variables essentially involved proving properties of polymorphic functions. The new model supports straightforward validations of all the test equivalences that have been proposed in the literature for local-variable semantics, and encompasses standard methods of reasoning about data representations. It is not known whether our techniques yield fully abstract semantics. A model based on partial equivalence relations on the natural numbers is also briefly examined.},

Heap operations are axiomatized using what we call the ``small axioms'', each of which mentions only those cells accessed by a particular command.

Compared with existing proposals, our method has several significant practical features: it works for general recursive functions on general algebraic data types; it does not produce extra runtime overhea (except for possible code size increase due to the success of fusion); and it is readily incorporated in standard inlining optimization. This is achieved by extending the ordinary inlining process with a new fusion law that transforms a term of the form f o (fixg{$\lambda$}x.E) to a new fixed point term fixh{$\lambda$}x.E{${'}$} by promoting the function f through the fixed point operator. This is a sound syntactic transformation rule that is not sensitive to the types of f and g. This property makes our method applicable to wide range of functions including those with multi-parameters in both curried and uncurried forms. Although this method does not guarantee any form of completeness, it fuses typical examples discussed in the literature and others that involve accumulating parameters, either in the tt foldl-like specific forms or in general recursive forms, without any additional machinery. In order to substantiate our claim, we have implemented our method in a compiler. Although it is preliminary, it demonstrates practical feasibility of this method.},

For this purpose, we first define a predicative second-order lambda calculus with finitary polymorphism, where each type abstraction is explicitly constrained to a finite type universe, and establishes the type soundness with respect to a type-passing operational semantics. Different from a calculus with stratified type universes, type universes of the calculus are terms that represent a finite set of instance types. We then develop a universe reconstruction algorithm that takes a term of the standard second-order lambda calculus, checks if the term is typable with finitary polymorphism, and, if typable, constructs a term in the calculus of finitary polymorphism. Based on these results, we present a type-based optimization method for polymorphic functions. Since our formalism is based on the second-order lambda calculus, it can be used to optimize various polymorphic languages. We implement the optimization method for native (tag-free) data representation and record polymorphism, and evaluate its effectiveness through benchmarks. The evaluation shows that 83.79\% of type passing abstractions are eliminated, and achieves the average of 15.28\% speed-up of compiled code.},

Our group's early experiences with personal computing led us to understand that the essential model of personal computing can be expressed much more compactly. Our group engaged in a project (called the STEPS project) to materialize that vision over the last six years. Several interesting results came out of the STEPS project. There are various meta-language implementations. A new stream-processing language called Nile was invented. The syntax of Nile allows a fully-featured vector graphics engine called Gezira to be written in a clean, mathematical manner in less than 500 lines of code. We also wrote a dynamic, yet declarative, graphical user interface framework in which we built a universal document editor. From the experience with the STEPS project, we are exploring the next steps; one of the directions is to incorporate the idea of using multiple constraint solvers to build a system. Solvers can help stronger "negotiation" between objects and languages, and help the system to be written in a more declarative manner. Another direction is to take the idea of loose-coupling to the next level; objects should not know about other objects directly but should always negotiate and "find" other objects. As the basic concept for this next stage, we are using the "Internet all the way down" analogy. The Internet has proven itself to be a great engineering feat: it scaled from just four nodes to billions of nodes without ever needing a full shutdown for maintenance. It is also likely that we can take out a random 10\% of the Internet's nodes and it will still keep running. By building a personal computing environment that consists of such nodes, or objects, perhaps we can make it never need to be restarted. Interestingly, J. C. R. Licklider already foresaw the need for program components to discover each other on a huge network of computers. From that viewpoint, what we are trying to do is to carry the vision forward.},

It begins by presenting a simple transformation of call-by-need {$\lambda$} terms into program graphs and a reducer for such graphs. From this, an informal derivation is carried out, resulting in a translation from {$\lambda$} terms into self-reducing program graphs, where the graphs are represented as CPS terms involving storage operations. Though informal, the derivation proceeds in simple steps, and the resulting translation is taken to be our canonical CPS transformation for call-by-need {$\lambda$} terms. In order to define the CPS transformation more formally, two alternative presentations are given. The first takes the form of a continuation semantics for the call-by-need language. The second presentation follows Danvy and Hatcliff's two-stage decomposition of the call-by-name CPS transformation, resulting in a similar two-stage CPS transformation for call-by-need. Finally, a number of practical matters are considered, including an improvement to eliminate the so-called administrative redexes, as well as to avoid unnecessary memoization and take advantage of strictness information. These improvements make it feasible to consider potential applications in compilers for call-by-need programming languages.},

Not only does Scala provide equivalents of all the necessary functional programming features (such parametric polymorphism, higher-order functions, higher-kinded type operations, and type- and constructor-classes), but it also provides the most useful features of object-oriented languages (such as subtyping, overriding, traditional single inheritance, and multiple inheritance in the form of traits).

We preserve type-safety statically and modularly: no reflection or similar mechanisms are used and modules can be independently compiled. The library is generic, in two senses: not only is it parametrised by both the return type and the shape of the object hierarchy, but also it allows a number of implementation choices (internal versus external control, imperative versus functional behaviour, orthogonal aspects such as tracing and memoisation) to be specified by parameters rather than fixed in early design decisions. Finally, we propose a generalised datatype-like notation,on top of our visitor library: this provides a convenient functional decomposition style in object-oriented languages.},

  abstract = {The expression families problem can be defined as the problem of achieving reusability and composability across the components involved in a family of related datatypes and corresponding operations over those datatypes. Like the traditional expression problem, adding new components (either variants or operations) should be possible while preserving modular and static type-safety. Moreover, different combinations of components should have different type identities and the subtyping relationships between components should be preserved. By generalizing previous work exploring the connection between type-theoretic encodings of datatypes and visitors, we propose two solutions for this problem in Scala using modular visitor components. These components can be grouped into features that can be easily composed in a feature-oriented programming style to obtain customized datatypes and operations.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a new solution to the expression problem (EP) that works in OO languages with simple generics (including Java or C\#). A key novelty of this solution is that advanced typing features, including F-bounded quantification, wildcards and variance annotations, are not needed. The solution is based on object algebras, which are an abstraction closely related to algebraic datatypes and Church encodings. Object algebras also have much in common with the traditional forms of the Visitor pattern, but without many of its drawbacks: they are extensible, remove the need for accept methods, and do not compromise encapsulation. We show applications of object algebras that go beyond toy examples usually presented in solutions for the expression problem. In the paper we develop an increasingly more complex set of features for a mini-imperative language, and we discuss a real-world application of object algebras in an implementation of remote batches. We believe that object algebras bring extensibility to the masses: object algebras work in mainstream OO languages, and they significantly reduce the conceptual overhead by using only features that are used by everyday programmers.},

Structured graphs extend conventional algebraic datatypes with explicit definition and manipulation of cycles and/or sharing, and offer a practical and convenient way to program graphs in functional programming languages like Haskell. The representation of sharing and cycles (edges) employs recursive binders and uses an encoding inspired by parametric higher-order abstract syntax. Unlike traditional approaches based on mutable references or node/edge lists, well-formedness of the graph structure is ensured statically and reasoning can be done with standard functional programming techniques. Since the binding structure is generic, we can define many useful generic combinators for manipulating structured graphs. We give applications and show how to reason about structured graphs.},

  abstract = {Programming languages often include specialized syntax for common datatypes (e.g. lists) and some also build in support for specific specialized datatypes (e.g. regular expressions), but user-defined types must use general-purpose syntax. Frustration with this causes developers to use strings, rather than structured data, with alarming frequency, leading to correctness, performance, security, and usability issues. Allowing library providers to modularly extend a language with new syntax could help address these issues. Unfortunately, prior mechanisms either limit expressiveness or are not safely composable: individually unambiguous extensions can still cause ambiguities when used together. We introduce type-specific languages (TSLs): logic associated with a type that determines how the bodies of generic literals, able to contain arbitrary syntax, are parsed and elaborated, hygienically. The TSL for a type is invoked only when a literal appears where a term of that type is expected, guaranteeing non-interference. We give evidence supporting the applicability of this approach and formally specify it with a bidirectionally typed elaboration semantics for the Wyvern programming language.},

  abstract = {Structure editors allow programmers to edit the tree structure of a program directly. This can have cognitive benefits, particularly for novice and end-user programmers (as evidenced by the popularity of structure editors like Scratch.) It also simplifies matters for tool designers, because they do not need to contend with malformed program text. This paper defines Hazelnut, a structure editor based on a small bidirectionally typed lambda calculus extended with holes and a cursor (a la Huet's zipper.) Hazelnut goes one step beyond syntactic well-formedness: it's edit actions operate over statically meaningful (i.e. well-typed) terms. Naively, this prohibition on ill-typed edit states would force the programmer to construct terms in a rigid "outside-in" manner. To avoid this problem, the action semantics automatically places terms assigned a type that is inconsistent with the expected type inside a hole. This safely defers the type consistency check until the term inside the hole is finished. Hazelnut is a foundational type-theoretic account of typed structure editing, rather than an end-user tool itself. To that end, we describe how Hazelnut's rich metatheory, which we have mechanized in Agda, guides the definition of an extension to the calculus. We also discuss various plausible evaluation strategies for terms with holes, and in so doing reveal connections with gradual typing and contextual modal type theory (the Curry-Howard interpretation of contextual modal logic.) Finally, we discuss how Hazelnut's semantics lends itself to implementation as a functional reactive program. Our reference implementation is written using js\_of\_ocaml.},

  abstract = {This paper develops a dynamic semantics for incomplete functional programs, starting from the static semantics developed in recent work on Hazelnut. We model incomplete functional programs as expressions with holes, with empty holes standing for missing expressions or types, and non-empty holes operating as membranes around static and dynamic type inconsistencies. Rather than aborting when evaluation encounters any of these holes as in some existing systems, evaluation proceeds around holes, tracking the closure around each hole instance as it flows through the remainder of the program. Editor services can use the information in these hole closures to help the programmer develop and confirm their mental model of the behavior of the complete portions of the program as they decide how to fill the remaining holes. Hole closures also enable a fill-and-resume operation that avoids the need to restart evaluation after edits that amount to hole filling. Formally, the semantics borrows machinery from both gradual type theory (which supplies the basis for handling unfilled type holes) and contextual modal type theory (which supplies a logical basis for hole closures), combining these and developing additional machinery necessary to continue evaluation past holes while maintaining type safety. We have mechanized the metatheory of the core calculus, called Hazelnut Live, using the Agda proof assistant. We have also implemented these ideas into the Hazel programming environment. The implementation inserts holes automatically, following the Hazelnut edit action calculus, to guarantee that every editor state has some (possibly incomplete) type. Taken together with this paper's type safety property, the result is a proof-of-concept live programming environment where rich dynamic feedback is truly available without gaps, i.e. for every reachable editor state.},

We provide such a semantics based on the novel structure of an indexed monad, which we introduce. We redefine the semantics of Moggi's computational lambda-calculus in terms of (strong) indexed monads which gives a one-to-one correspondence between indices of the denotations and the effect annotations of traditional effect systems. Dually, this approach yields indexed comonads which gives a unified semantics and effect system to contextual notions of effect (called coeffects), which we have previously described.},

The former is usually developed in the context of the lambda-calculus and its variants, the latter for the pi-calculus. In this paper we explore their relative expressive power. Firstly, we give an embedding from PCF, augmented with a parameterised effect system, into a session-typed pi-calculus (session calculus), showing that session types are powerful enough to express effects. Secondly, we give a reverse embedding, from the session calculus back into PCF, by instantiating PCF with concurrency primitives and its effect system with a session-like effect algebra; effect systems are powerful enough to express sessions. The embedding of session types into an effect system is leveraged to give a new implementation of session types in Haskell, via an effect system encoding. The correctness of this implementation follows from the second embedding result. We also discuss various extensions to our embeddings.},

However, often non-standard composition semantics is needed, with a mixture of composition mechanisms. Such non-standard semantics are simulated by complicated architectures that are sensitive to requirement changes and cannot easily be adapted without invalidating existing clients. In this paper, we propose compound references, a new abstraction for object references, that allows us to provide explicit linguistic means for expressing and combining individual composition properties on-demand. The model is statically typed and allows the programmer to express a seamless spectrum of composition semantics in the interval between object composition and inheritance. The resulting programs are better understandable, due to explicity expressed design decisions, and less sensitive to requirement changes.},

We have defined a calculus, GADTTGADTTGADT\^T, which unifies GADTs and GAcoDTs in such a way that GADTs and GAcoDTs are merely different ways to partition the program.We have formalized the type system and operational semantics of GADTTGADTTGADT\^T in the Coq proof assistant and have mechanically verified the following results: (1) The type system of GADTTGADTTGADT\^T is sound, (2) defunctionalization and refunctionalization can translate GADTs to GAcoDTs and back, (3) both transformations are type- and semantics-preserving and are inverses of each other, (4) (co-)datatypes can be represented by matrices in such a way the aforementioned transformations correspond to matrix transposition, (5) GADTs are extensible in an exactly dual way to GAcoDTs; we thereby clarify folklore knowledge about the ``expression problem''.We believe that the identification of this relationship can guide future language design of ``dual features'' for data and codata.},

  abstract = {First-class functions dramatically increase expressiveness, at the expense of static guarantees. In ALGOL or PASCAL, functions could be passed as arguments but never escape their defining scope. Therefore, function arguments could serve as temporary access tokens or capabilities, enabling callees to perform some action, but only for the duration of the call. In modern languages, such programming patterns are no longer available. The central thrust of this paper is to re-introduce second-class functions and other values alongside first-class entities in modern languages. We formalize second-class values with stack-bounded lifetimes as an extension to simply-typed {\^I}\guillemotright{} calculus, and for richer type systems such as F{$<$}: and systems with path-dependent types. We generalize the binary first- vs second-class distinction to arbitrary privilege lattices, with the underlying type lattice as a special case. In this setting, abstract types naturally enable privilege parametricity. We prove type soundness and lifetime properties in Coq. We implement our system as an extension of Scala, and present several case studies. First, we modify the Scala Collections library and add privilege annotations to all higher-order functions. Privilege parametricity is key to retain the high degree of code-reuse between sequential and parallel as well as lazy and eager collections. Second, we use scoped capabilities to introduce a model of checked exceptions in the Scala library, with only few changes to the code. Third, we employ second-class capabilities for memory safety in a region-based off-heap memory library.},

We do not claim the invention of this style of semantics: our contribution here is to clarify its value, and to explain how it supports several language features that might appear to require a relational or small-step approach. We illustrate the technique on a simple imperative language with C-like for-loops and a break statement, and compare it to a variety of other approaches.

With our own experience in designing inexact physical systems including hardware as a backdrop, we speculate on the rich potential for considering inexactness as a broad emerging theme if not an entire domain for investigation for exciting research and innovation. If this emerging trend to pursuing inexactness persists and grows, then we anticipate an increasing need to consider system co-design where application domain characteristics and technology features interplay in an active manner. A noteworthy early example of this approach is our own excursion into tailoring and hence co-designing floating point arithmetic units guided by the needs of stochastic climate models. This approach requires a unified effort between software and hardware designers that does away with the normal clean abstraction layers between the two.},

  abstract = {We address the problem of computing semantic differences between a program and a patched version of the program. Our goal is to obtain a precise characterization of the difference between program versions, or establish their equivalence when no difference exists. We focus on computing semantic differences in numerical programs where the values of variables have no a-priori bounds, and use abstract interpretation to compute an over-approximation of program differences. Computing differences and establishing equivalence under abstraction requires abstracting relationships between variables in the two programs. Towards that end, we first construct a correlating program in which these relationships can be tracked, and then use a correlating abstract domain to compute a sound approximation of these relationships. To better establish equivalence between correlated variables and precisely capture differences, our domain has to represent non-convex information using a partially-disjunctive abstract domain. To balance precision and cost of this representation, our domain over-approximates numerical information while preserving equivalence between correlated variables by dynamically partitioning the disjunctive state according to equivalence criteria. We have implemented our approach in a tool called DIZY, and applied it to a number of real-world examples, including programs from the GNU core utilities, Mozilla Firefox and the Linux Kernel. Our evaluation shows that DIZY often manages to establish equivalence, describes precise approximation of semantic differences when difference exists, and reports only a few false differences.},

  abstract = {Compilers for statically typed functional programming languages are notorious for generating confusing type error messages. When the compiler detects a type error, it typically reports the program location where the type checking failed as the source of the error. Since other error sources are not even considered, the actual root cause is often missed. A more adequate approach is to consider all possible error sources and report the most useful one subject to some usefulness criterion. In our previous work, we showed that this approach can be formulated as an optimization problem related to satisfiability modulo theories (SMT). This formulation cleanly separates the heuristic nature of usefulness criteria from the underlying search problem. Unfortunately, algorithms that search for an optimal error source cannot directly use principal types which are crucial for dealing with the exponential-time complexity of the decision problem of polymorphic type checking. In this paper, we present a new algorithm that efficiently finds an optimal error source in a given ill-typed program. Our algorithm uses an improved SMT encoding to cope with the high complexity of polymorphic typing by iteratively expanding the typing constraints from which principal types are derived. The algorithm preserves the clean separation between the heuristics and the actual search. We have implemented our algorithm for OCaml. In our experimental evaluation, we found that the algorithm reduces the running times for optimal type error localization from minutes to seconds and scales better than previous localization algorithms.},

Whilst this makes it hard to ensure the system is sound, it also makes it difficult to extend as the language evolves. We are interested in describing type systems using declarative rewrite rules from which an implementation can be automatically generated. Whilst not all type systems are easily expressed in this manner, those involving unions, intersections and negations are well-suited for this.   In this paper, we consider a relatively complex type system involving unions, intersections and negations developed previously. This system was not developed with rewriting in mind, though clear parallels are immediately apparent from the original presentation. For example, the system presented required types be first converted into a variation on Disjunctive Normal Form. We identify that the original system can, for the most part, be reworked to enable a natural expression using declarative rewrite rules. We present an implementation of our rewrite rules in the Whiley Rewrite Language (WyRL), and report performance results compared with a hand-coded solution.},

We present techniques for specifying flexible and rich slicing criteria based on partial expressions, parts of which have been replaced by holes. We characterise program slices in an algorithm-independent fashion and show that a least slice for a given criterion exists. We then present an algorithm, called unevaluation, for computing least program slices from computations reified as traces. Observing a limitation of program slices, we develop a notion of trace slice as another form of explanation and present an algorithm for computing them. The unevaluation algorithm can be applied to any subtrace of a trace slice to compute a program slice whose evaluation generates that subtrace. This close correspondence between programs, traces, and their slices can enable the programmer to understand a computation interactively, in terms of the programming language in which the computation is expressed. We present an implementation in the form of a tool, discuss some important practical implementation concerns and present some techniques for addressing them.},

In this paper, we introduce a novel extension and application of symbolic execution techniques that computes a precise behavioral characterization of a program change. This technique, which we call differential symbolic execution (DSE), exploits the fact that program versions are largely similar to reduce cost and improve the quality of analysis results. We define the foundational concepts of DSE, describe cost-effective tool support for DSE, and illustrate its potential benefit through an exploratory study that considers version histories of two Java code bases.},

  abstract = {Production compilers for programming languages face multiple requirements. They should be correct, as we rely on them to produce code. They should be fast, in order to provide a good developer experience. They should also be easy to maintain and evolve. This thesis shows how an expressive high level type system can be used to simplify the development of a compiler and demonstrates this on a compiler for Scala. First, it shows how expressive types of high level languages can be used to build internal data structures that provide a statically checked API, ensuring that important properties hold at compile time. Second, we also show how high level language features can be used to abstract the components of a compiler. We demonstrate this by introducing a type-safe layer on top of the bytecode emission phase. This makes it possible to abstract away the implementation details of the compiler frontend and run the same bytecode emission phase in two different Scala compilers. Third, it presents MiniPhases, a novel way to organize transformation passes in a compiler. MiniPhases impose constraints on the organization of passes that are beneficial for maintainability, performance, and testability. We include a detailed performance evaluation of MiniPhases which indicates that their speedup is due to improved cache friendliness and to a lower rate of promotions of objects into the old generations of garbage collectors. Finally, we demonstrate how the expressive type system of the language being compiled can be used for static analysis. We present a novel call graph construction algorithm which uses the typing context for context sensitivity. The resulting algorithm is both substantially faster and more precise than existing alternatives. We demonstrate the applicability of this analysis by extending common subexpression elimination to idempotent expression elimination. Petrashko, Dmytro},

Yet this language feature, in its traditional form, is limited: patterns must be data constructors of concrete data types. No computation or abstraction is allowed. The data type in question must be concrete, with no ability to enforce any invariants. Any change in this data type requires all clients to update their code.   This paper introduces pattern synonyms, which allow programmers to abstract over patterns, painting over all the shortcomings listed above. Pattern synonyms are assigned types, enabling a compiler to check the validity of a synonym independent of its definition. These types are intricate; detailing how to assign a type to a pattern synonym is a key contribution of this work. We have implemented pattern synonyms in the Glasgow Haskell Compiler, where they have enjoyed immediate popularity, but we believe this feature could easily be exported to other languages that support pattern matching.},

An approach to Reynolds' notion of relational parametricity is developed that works directly on the syntax of a programming language, using a novel closure operator to relate operational behaviour to parametricity properties of types. Working with an extension of Plotkin's PCF with {$\forall$}-types, lazy lists and existential types, we show by example how the resulting logical relation can be used to prove properties of polymorphic types up to operational equivalence.},

Continuation-passing style (CPS) is well-known to cure this severe dependence of performance on the association pattern. The advantage of CPS dwindles or disappears if we have to examine or modify the intermediate result of a series of appends or binds, before continuing the series. Such examination is frequently needed, for example, to control search in non-determinism monads. We present an alternative approach that is just as general as CPS but more robust: it makes series of binds and other such operations efficient regardless of the association pattern-- and also provides efficient access to intermediate results. The key is to represent such a conceptual sequence as an efficient sequence data structure. Efficient sequence data structures from the literature are homogeneous and cannot be applied as they are in a type-safe way to series of monadic binds. We generalize them to type aligned sequences and show how to construct their (assuredly order-preserving) implementations. We demonstrate that our solution solves previously undocumented, severe performance problems in iteratees, LogicT transformers, free monads and extensible effects.},

We show that our extension allows us to safely do things we could not otherwise do: it allows us to implement the ST monad (inefficiently), to implement an embedded form of arrow notation, and to translate parametric HOAS to typed de Bruijn indices, among others. Although strongly related to the ST monad, the Key monad is simpler and might be easier to prove safe. We do not provide such a proof of the safety of the Key monad, but we note that, surprisingly, a full proof of the safety of the ST monad also remains elusive to this day. Hence, another reason for studying the Key monad is that a safety proof for it might be a stepping stone towards a safety proof of the ST monad.},

To avoid semantic ambiguity, such a semantics is expected to be coherent, i.e., independent of the typing derivation for a given typing judgment. In this article we present heterogeneous, biorthogonal, step-indexed logical relations for establishing the coherence of coercion semantics of programming languages with subtyping. To illustrate the effectiveness of the proof method, we develop a proof of coherence of a type-directed, selective CPS translation from a typed call-by-value lambda calculus with delimited continuations and control-effect subtyping.

This paper presents a technological approach for reducing the problem of believing a formal proof to the same psychological and philosophical issues as believing a conventional proof in a mathematics journal. I split the question of belief into two parts; asking whether the claimed proof is actually a derivation in the claimed formal system, and then whether what it proves is the claimed theorem. The first question is addressed by independent checking of formal proofs. I discuss how this approach extends the informal notion of proof as surveyable by human readers, and how surveyability of proofs reappears as the issue of feasibility of proof-checking. The second question has no technical answer; I discuss how it appears in verification of computer systems.}

Defunctionalization has been used both as a reasoning tool and as a compilation technique.Defunctionalization is commonly defined and studied in the setting of a simply-typed {$\lambda$}-calculus, where it is shown that semantics and well-typedness are preserved. It has been observed that, in the setting of a polymorphic type system, such as ML or System F, defunctionalization is not type-preserving. In this paper, we show that extending System F with guarded algebraic data types allows recovering type preservation. This result allows adding defunctionalization to the toolbox of type-preserving compiler writers.},

This ``relativity'' has frequently been regarded as paradoxical; but today, although one hears the expression ``the L{\"o}wenheim-Skolem Paradox'', it seems to be thought of as only an apparent paradox, something the cognoscenti enjoy but are not seriously troubled by. Thus van Heijenoort writes, ``The existence of such a `relativity' is sometimes referred to as the L{\"o}wenheim-Skolem Paradox. But, of course, it is not a paradox in the sense of an antinomy; it is a novel and unexpected feature of formal systems.'' In this address I want to take up Skolem's arguments, not with the aim of refuting them but with the aim of extending them in somewhat the direction he seemed to be indicating. It is not my claim that the ``L{\"o}wenheim-Skolem Paradox'' is an antinomy in formal logic; but I shall argue that it is an antinomy, or something close to it, in philosophy of language. Moreover, I shall argue that the resolution of the antinomy\textemdash{}the only resolution that I myself can see as making sense\textemdash{}has profound implications for the great metaphysical dispute about realism which has always been the central dispute in the philosophy of language.The structure of my argument will be as follows: I shall point out that in many different areas there are three main positions on reference and truth: there is the extreme Platonist position, which posits nonnatural mental powers of directly ``grasping'' forms (it is characteristic of this position that ``understanding'' or ``grasping'' is itself an irreducible and unexplicated notion); there is the verificationist position which replaces the classical notion of truth with the notion of verification or proof, at least when it comes to describing how the language is understood; and there is the moderate realist position which seeks to preserve the centrality of the classical notions of truth and reference without postulating nonnatural mental powers.},

  month = nov,
  abstract = {This thesis concerns the implementation of Lambda Prolog, a higher-order logic programming language that supports the lambda-tree syntax approach to representing and manipulating formal syntactic objects. Lambda Prolog achieves its functionality by extending a Prolog-like language by using typed lambda terms as data structures that it then manipulates via higher-order unification and some new program-level abstraction mechanisms. These additional features raise new implementation questions that must be adequately addressed for Lambda Prolog to be an effective programming tool. We consider these questions here, providing eventually a virtual machine and compilation based realization. A key idea is the orientation of the computation model of Lambda Prolog around a restricted version of higher-order unification with nice algorithmic properties and appearing to encompass most interesting applications. Our virtual machine embeds a treatment of this form of unification within the structure of the Warren Abstract Machine that is used in traditional Prolog implementations. Along the way, we treat various auxiliary issues such as the low-level representation of lambda terms, the implementation of reduction on such terms and the optimized processing of types in computation. We also develop an actual implementation of Lambda Prolog called Teyjus Version 2. A characteristic of this system is that it realizes an emulator for the virtual machine in the C language a compiler in the OCaml language. We present a treatment of the software issues that arise from this kind of mixing of languages within one system and we discuss issues relevant to the portability of our virtual machine emulator across arbitrary architectures. Finally, we assess the the efficacy of our various design ideas through experiments carried out using the system.},

Masked types are a new type-state mechanism that explicitly tracks the initialization state of objects and prevents reading from uninitialized fields. In the resulting language, constructors are ordinary methods that operate on uninitialized objects, and no special default value (null) is needed in the language. Initialization of cyclic data structures is achieved with the use of conditionally masked types. Masked types are modular and compatible with data abstraction. The type system is presented in a simplified object calculus and is proved to soundly prevent reading from uninitialized fields. Masked types have been implemented as an extension to Java, in which compilation simply erases extra type information. Experience using the extended language suggests that masked types work well on real code.},

Class sharing integrates these two kinds of extensibility mechanisms. With little programmer effort, objects of one family can be used as members of another, while preserving relationships among objects. Therefore, a family of classes can be adapted in place with new functionality spanning multiple classes. Object graphs can evolve from one family to another, adding or removing functionality even at run time. Several new mechanisms support this flexibility while ensuring type safety. Class sharing has been implemented as an extension to Java, and its utility for evolving and extending software is demonstrated with realistic systems.},

This is achieved through a new mechanism, shadow classes, which permit homogeneous sharing of all related classes in shared families. The new sharing mechanism has a straightforward semantics, which is formalized in the J\&h calculus. The soundness of the J\&h type system is proved. The J\&h language is implemented as an extension to the J\& language. To demonstrate the effectiveness of family sharing, the Polyglot compiler framework is ported to J\&h.},

Besides extending the logical relation principle to more general languages, an important research question has been how to represent and thus verify logical relation arguments in logical frameworks. We formulate a theory of logical relations for Dependent Type Theory (DTT) with {$\beta$} {$\eta$}-equality which guarantees that any valid logical relation satisfies the Basic Lemma. Our definition is syntactic and reflective in the sense that a relation at a type is represented as a DTT type family but also permits expressing certain semantic definitions. We use the Edinburgh Logical Framework (LF) incarnation of DTT and implement our notion of logical relations in the type-checker Twelf. This enables us to formalize and mechanically decide the validity of logical relation arguments. Furthermore, our implementation includes a module system so that logical relations can be built modularly. We validate our approach by formalizing and verifying several syntactic and semantic meta-theorems in Twelf. Moreover, we show how object languages encoded in DTT can inherit a notion of logical relation from the logical framework.},

  abstract = {In Martin-L\textbackslash{}"of's Intensional Type Theory, identity type is a heavily used and studied concept. The reason for that is the fact that it's responsible for the recently discovered connection between Type Theory and Homotopy Theory. The main problem with identity types, as originally formulated, is that they are complex to understand and use. Using that fact as motivation, a much simpler formulation for the identity type was proposed by Anjolina de Oliveira and Ruy de Queiroz. In this formulation, an element of an identity type is seen as a sequence of rewrites (or computational paths). Together with the logical rules of this new entity, there exists a system of reduction rules between sequence of rewrites called LND\_EQS-RWS. This system is constructed using the labelled natural deduction (i.e. Prawitz' Natural Deduction plus derivations-as-terms) and is responsible for establishing how a sequence of rewrites can be rewritten, resulting in a new sequence of rewrites. In this context, we propose a categorical interpretation for this new entity, using the types as objects and the rules of rewrites as morphisms. Moreover, we show that our interpretation is in accordance with some known results, like that types have a groupoidal structure. We also interpret more complicated structures, like the one formed by a rewrite of a sequence of rewrites.},

  abstract = {Relocation adjusts machine instructions to account for changes in the locations of the instructions themselves or of external symbols to which they refer. Standard linkers implement a finite set of relocation transformations, suitable for a single architecture. These transformations are enumerated, named, and engraved in a machine-dependent object-file format, and linkers must recognize them by name. These names and their associated transformations are an unnecessary source of machine-dependence.The New Jersey Machine-Code Toolkit is an application generator. It helps programmers create applications that manipulate machine code, including linkers. Guided by a short instruction-set specification, the toolkit generates the bit-manipulating code. Instructions are described by constructors, which denote functions mapping lists of operands to instructions' binary representations. Any operand can be designated as "relocatable," meaning that the operand's value need not be known at the time the instruction is encoded. For instructions with relocatable operands, the toolkit computes relocating transformations. Tool writers can use the toolkit to create machine-independent software that relocates machine instructions. mld, a retargetable linker built with the toolkit, needs only 20 lines of C code for relocation, and that code is machine-independent.The toolkit discovers relocating transformations by currying encoding functions. An attempt to encode an instruction with a relocatable operand results in the creation of a closure. The closure can be applied when the values of the relocatable operands become known. Currying provides a general, machine-independent method of relocation.Currying rewrites a \&lambda;-term into two nested \&lambda;-terms. The standard implementation has the first \&lambda; allocate a closure and store therein its operands and a pointer to the second \&lambda;. Using this strategy in the toolkit means that, when it builds an application, the toolkit generates code for many different inner \&lambda;-terms---one for each instruction that uses a relocatable address. Hoisting some of the computation out of the second \&lambda; into the first makes many of the second \&lambda;s identical---a handful are enough for a whole instruction set. This optimization reduces the size of machine-dependent assembly and linking code by 15--20\% for the MIPS, SPARC, and PowerPC, and by about 30\% for the Pentium. It also makes the second \&lambda;s equivalent to relocating transformations named in standard object-file formats.},

By contrast, previous work builds the conflict-resolution policy into the specification, or worse, does not specify the synchronizer's behavior precisely. We classify synchronizers by asking whether conflicts can be resolved at a single disconnected replica and whether all replicas are identical after synchronization. We also discuss timestamps and argue that there is no good way to propagate timestamps when there is severe clock skew between replicas.},

But the monadic implementation of the expectation query can be much less efficient than current best practices in probabilistic modeling. We therefore present a language of measure terms, which can not only denote discrete probability distributions but can also support the best known modeling techniques. We give a translation of stochastic lambda calculus into measure terms.

  abstract = {Dependent Object Types (DOT) is intended to be a core calculus for modelling Scala. Its distinguishing feature is abstract type members, fields in objects that hold types rather than values. Proving soundness of DOT has been surprisingly challenging, and existing proofs are complicated, and reason about multiple concepts at the same time (e.g. types, values, evaluation). To serve as a core calculus for Scala, DOT should be easy to experiment with and extend, and therefore its soundness proof needs to be easy to modify.   This paper presents a simple and modular proof strategy for reasoning in DOT. The strategy separates reasoning about types from other concerns. It is centred around a theorem that connects the full DOT type system to a restricted variant in which the challenges and paradoxes caused by abstract type members are eliminated. Almost all reasoning in the proof is done in the intuitive world of this restricted type system. Once we have the necessary results about types, we observe that the other aspects of DOT are mostly standard and can be incorporated into a soundness proof using familiar techniques known from other calculi.},

Unfortunately, existing formulations of DOT can model only types of the form \$x.A\$ which depend on variables rather than general paths. This restriction makes it impossible to model nested module dependencies. Nesting small components inside larger ones is a necessary ingredient of a modular, scalable language. DOT's variable restriction thus undermines its ability to fully formalize a variety of programming-language features including Scala's module system, family polymorphism, and covariant specialization. This paper presents the pDOT calculus, which generalizes DOT to support types that depend on paths of arbitrary length, as well as singleton types to track path equality. We show that naive approaches to add paths to DOT make it inherently unsound, and present necessary conditions for such a calculus to be sound. We discuss the key changes necessary to adapt the techniques of the DOT soundness proofs so that they can be applied to pDOT. Our paper comes with a Coq-mechanized type-safety proof of pDOT. With support for paths of arbitrary length, pDOT can realize DOT's full potential for formalizing Scala-like calculi.},

Assertions are extended by introducing a "separating conjunction" that asserts that its subformulas hold for disjoint parts of the heap, and a closely related "separating implication". Coupled with the inductive definition of predicates on abstract data structures, this extension permits the concise and flexible description of structures with controlled sharing.

Unfortunately, these verifications demand such heroic manual proof effort, even for a single system, that the approach has not been widely adopted. We demonstrate a technique to eliminate the manual proof burden for verifying many properties within an entire class of applications, in our case reactive systems, while only expending effort comparable to the manual verification of a single system. A crucial insight of our approach is simultaneously designing both (1) a domain-specific language (DSL) for expressing reactive systems and their correctness properties and (2) proof automation which exploits the constrained language of both programs and properties to enable fully automatic, pushbutton verification. We apply this insight in a deeply embedded Coq DSL, dubbed Reflex, and illustrate Reflex's expressiveness by implementing and automatically verifying realistic systems including a modern web browser, an SSH server, and a web server.

The aim of this paper is to use the different technology of internal category theory to re-examine Ma and Reynolds' definitions. Apart from clarifying some of their constructions, this view enables us to prove that if we start with a non-parametric model which is left exact and which satisfies a completeness condition corresponding to Ma and Reynolds ``suitability for polymorphism'', then we can recover a parametric model with the same category of closed types. This implies, for example, that any suitably complete model (such as the PER model) has a parametric counterpart},

Through extensive use of component technology, lightweight modular staging makes an optimizing compiler framework available at the library level, allowing programmers to tightly integrate domain-specific abstractions and optimizations into the generation process. We argue that lightweight modular staging enables a form of language virtualization, i.e. allows to go from a pure-library embedded language to one that is practically equivalent to a stand-alone implementation with only modest effort.},

  abstract = {Good software engineering practice demands generalization and abstraction, whereas high performance demands specialization and concretization. These goals are at odds, and compilers can only rarely translate expressive high-level programs to modern hardware platforms in a way that makes best use of the available resources. Generative programming is a promising alternative to fully automatic translation. Instead of writing down the target program directly, developers write a program generator, which produces the target program as its output. The generator can be written in a high-level, generic style and can still produce efficient, specialized target programs. In practice, however, developing high-quality program generators requires a very large effort that is often hard to amortize. We present lightweight modular staging (LMS), a generative programming approach that lowers this effort significantly. LMS seamlessly combines program generator logic with the generated code in a single program, using only types to distinguish the two stages of execution. Through extensive use of component technology, LMS makes a reusable and extensible compiler framework available at the library level, allowing programmers to tightly integrate domain-specific abstractions and optimizations into the generation process, with common generic optimizations provided by the framework. LMS is well suited to develop embedded domain-specific languages (DSLs) and has been used to develop powerful performance-oriented DSLs for demanding domains such as machine learning, with code generation for heterogeneous platforms including GPUs. LMS has also been used to generate SQL for embedded database queries and JavaScript for web applications.},

Modern JIT compilers, such as those in virtual machines like Oracle's HotSpot for Java or Google's V8 for JavaScript, rely on dynamic profiling as their key mechanism to guide optimizations. While these JIT compilers offer good average performance, their behavior is a black box and the achieved performance is highly unpredictable. In this paper, we propose to turn JIT compilation into a precision tool by adding two essential and generic metaprogramming facilities: First, allow programs to invoke JIT compilation explicitly. This enables controlled specialization of arbitrary code at run-time, in the style of partial evaluation. It also enables the JIT compiler to report warnings and errors to the program when it is unable to compile a code path in the demanded way. Second, allow the JIT compiler to call back into the program to perform compile-time computation. This lets the program itself define the translation strategy for certain constructs on the fly and gives rise to a powerful JIT macro facility that enables "smart" libraries to supply domain-specific compiler optimizations or safety checks. We present Lancet, a JIT compiler framework for Java bytecode that enables such a tight, two-way integration with the running program. Lancet itself was derived from a high-level Java bytecode interpreter: staging the interpreter using LMS (Lightweight Modular Staging) produced a simple bytecode compiler. Adding abstract interpretation turned the simple compiler into an optimizing compiler. This fact provides compelling evidence for the scalability of the staged-interpreter approach to compiler construction. In the case of Lancet, JIT macros also provide a natural interface to existing LMS-based toolchains such as the Delite parallelism and DSL framework, which can now serve as accelerator macros for arbitrary JVM bytecode.},

The Dependent Object Types (DOT) family of calculi has been proposed as a new foundation for Scala and similar languages. Unfortunately, it is not clear how DOT relates to any well-known type systems, and type soundness has only been established for very restricted subsets. In fact, important Scala features are known to break at least one key metatheoretic property such as environment narrowing or subtyping transitivity, which are usually required for a type soundness proof. First, and, perhaps surprisingly, we show how rich DOT calculi can still be proved sound. The key insight is that narrowing and subtyping transitivity only need to hold for runtime objects, but not for code that is never executed. Alas, the dominant method of proving type soundness, Wright and Felleisen's syntactic approach, is based on term rewriting, which does not a priori make a distinction between runtime and type assignment time. Second, we demonstrate how type soundness can be proved for advanced, polymorphic, type systems with respect to high-level, definitional interpreters, implemented in Coq. We present the first mechanized soundness proof in this style for System F{$<$}: and several extensions, including mutable references. Our proofs use only simple induction: another surprising result, as the combination of big-step semantics, mutable references, and polymorphism is commonly believed to require co-inductive proof techniques. Third, we show how DOT-like calculi emerge as generalizations of F{$<$}:, exposing a rich design space of calculi with path-dependent types which we collectively call System D. Armed with insights from the definitional interpreter semantics, we also show how equivalent small-step semantics and soundness proofs in Wright-Felleisen-style can be derived for these systems.},

The key enabler is a shift in perspective towards generative programming. The core of the query engine is an interpreter for relational algebra operations, written in Scala. Using the open-source LMS Framework (Lightweight Modular Staging), we turn this interpreter into a query compiler with very low effort. To do so, we capitalize on an old and widely known result from partial evaluation known as Futamura projections, which state that a program that can specialize an interpreter to any given input program is equivalent to a compiler. In this pearl, we discuss LMS programming patterns such as mixed-stage data structures (e.g. data records with static schema and dynamic field components) and techniques to generate low-level C code, including specialized data structures and data loading primitives.},

The main contribution of this paper is to demonstrate how, perhaps surprisingly, even though these properties are lost in their full generality, a rich DOT calculus that includes recursive type refinement and a subtyping lattice with intersection types can still be proved sound. The key insight is that subtyping transitivity only needs to be invertible in code paths executed at runtime, with contexts consisting entirely of valid runtime objects, whereas inconsistent subtyping contexts can be permitted for code that is never executed.},

To do so, we give a very simple elaboration semantics for a full-featured, higher-order ML-like module language. Our elaboration defines the meaning of module expressions by a straightforward, compositional translation into vanilla System F-{$\omega$} (the higher-order polymorphic {$\lambda$}-calculus), under plain F-{$\omega$} typing environments. We thereby show that ML modules are merely a particular mode of use of System F-{$\omega$}. Our module language supports the usual second-class modules with Standard ML-style generative functors and local module definitions. To demonstrate the versatility of our approach, we further extend the language with the ability to package modules as first-class values---a very simple extension, as it turns out. Our approach also scales to handle OCaml-style applicative functor semantics, but the details are significantly more subtle, so we leave their presentation to a future, expanded version of this paper. Lastly, we report on our experience using the "locally nameless" approach in order to mechanize the soundness of our elaboration semantics in Coq.},

Mixin modules facilitate recursive linking of separately compiled components, but they are not hierarchically composable and typically do not support type abstraction. We synthesize the complementary advantages of these two mechanisms in a novel module system design we call MixML. A MixML module is like an ML structure in which some of the components are specified but not defined. In other words, it unifies the ML structure and signature languages into one. MixML seamlessly integrates hierarchical composition, translucent ML-style data abstraction, and mixin-style recursive linking. Moreover, the design of MixML is clean and minimalist; it emphasizes how all the salient, semantically interesting features of the ML module system (and several proposed extensions to it) can be understood simply as stylized uses of a small set of orthogonal underlying constructs, with mixin composition playing a central role. We provide a declarative type system for MixML, including two important extensions: higher-order modules, and modules as first-class values. We also present a sound and complete, three-pass type-checking algorithm for this system. The operational semantics of MixML is defined by an elaboration translation into an internal core language called LTG---namely, a polymorphic lambda calculus with single-assignment references and recursive type generativity---which employs a linear type and kind system to track definedness of term and type imports.},

To demonstrate the scalability of our ``F-ing'' semantics, we use it to define a representative, higher-order ML-style module language, encompassing all the major features of existing ML module dialects (except for recursive modules). We thereby show that ML modules are merely a particular mode of use of System F{$\omega$}. To streamline the exposition, we present the semantics of our module language in stages. We begin by defining a subset of the language supporting a Standard ML-like language with second-class modules and generative functors. We then extend this sublanguage with the ability to package modules as first-class values (a very simple extension, as it turns out) and OCaml-style applicative functors (somewhat harder). Unlike previous work combining both generative and applicative functors, we do not require two distinct forms of functor or signature sealing. Instead, whether a functor is applicative or not depends only on the computational purity of its body. In fact, we argue that applicative/generative is rather incidental terminology for pure versus impure functors. This approach results in a semantics that we feel is simpler and more natural than previous accounts, and moreover prohibits breaches of abstraction safety that were possible under them.},

  abstract = {Type-and-effect systems are a well-studied approach for reasoning about the computational behavior of programs. Nevertheless, there is only one example of an effect system that has been adopted in a wide-spread industrial language: Java's checked exceptions. We believe that the main obstacle to using effect systems in day-to-day programming is their verbosity, especially when writing functions that are polymorphic in the effect of their argument. To overcome this issue, we propose a new syntactically lightweight technique for writing effect-polymorphic functions. We show its independence from a specific kind of side-effect by embedding it into a generic and extensible framework for checking effects of multiple domains. Finally, we verify the expressiveness and practicality of the system by implementing it for the Scala programming language.},

  year = {2010},
  abstract = {While object-oriented languages are designed for information hiding and data encapsulation, intensive data manipulation often calls for pattern matching, one of the main features of functional programming languages. Pattern matching provides a concise way to describe specific structures or conditions of objects so that programmers can clearly identify and easily access the corresponding objects. The need for both object information hiding and pattern matching over objects, which are seemingly conflicting features, shows up very well in the problem of language manipulation. In the compiler development of Fortress, a new object-oriented language with extensive support for functional programming, we originally implemented the Fortress type checker in Java. However, because Java does not provide pattern matching, we reimplemented the type checker in Scala. Compared to the pattern matching mechanism in Scala, Java's visitor patterns are verbose, make it hard to capture the high-level specification of objects, and are nontrivial to maintain. In this paper, we introduce a new pattern-matching mechanism which can be added to existing object-oriented languages. We present the mechanism currently being implemented as an addition to the Fortress programming language. The mechanism provides a concise way of describing and using patterns in the presence of runtime manipulation of types using typecase and multimethods, unlike Scala which has type-erasure semantics. Even though it is premature to discuss the performance and scalability of the presented mechanism, we believe that the same optimization techniques used in Scala will apply to our mechanism.}

We show that Plotkin's CPS translation, Moggi's monad translation, and Girard's translation to linear logic can all be regarded as reflections form this source language, and we put forward the computational lambda calculus as a model of call-by-value computation that improves on the traditional  call-by-value calculus. Our work strengthens Plotkin's and Moggi's original results and improves on recent work based on equational correspondence, which uses equations rather than reductions.},

In this paper, we provide a research roadmap to overcome the limitations of the current approaches and to support reactive applications in the OO setting. To establish a solid background for our investigation, we propose a conceptual framework to model the design space of reactive applications and we study the flaws of the existing solutions.

Adding new optimizations often requires major restructuring of existing passes that cannot be understood in isolation. The steep learning curve is daunting, and even experienced developers find it hard to modify existing passes without introducing subtle and tenacious bugs. These problems are especially frustrating when the developer is a student in a compiler class.An attractive alternative is to structure a compiler as a collection of many small passes, each of which performs a single task. This "micropass" structure aligns the actual implementation of a compiler with its logical organization, simplifying development, testing, and debugging. Unfortunately, writing many small passes duplicates code for traversing and rewriting abstract syntax trees and can obscure the meaningful transformations performed by individual passes.To address these problems, we have developed a methodology and associated tools that simplify the task of building compilers composed of many fine-grained passes. We describe these compilers as "nanopass" compilers to indicate both the intended granularity of the passes and the amount of source code required to implement each pass. This paper describes the methodology and tools comprising the nanopass framework.},

We propose a metaprogrammatic approach for extracting domain-specific programs from user programs for custom processing.

This makes sense when one regards them to be on the same level as traditional, non-EDSL library interfaces. However, this equivalence only applies to the simplest of EDSLs. In this paper we illustrate why this is detrimental when moving on to EDSLs that employ staging, i.e. program reification, by example of various issues that affect authors and users alike. We believe that if EDSLs are to be considered a reliable, language-like interface abstraction, they require exceptional attention and design scrutiny. Instead of unenforceable conventions, we advocate the acceptance of EDSLs as proper, i.e. almost first-class, citizens while retaining most advantages of pure embeddings. As a small step towards this goal, we present a pragmatic framework prototype for Java. It is based on annotations that explicate and document membership to explicit EDSL entities. In a nutshell, our framework identifies (annotated) method calls and field accesses as EDSL terms and dynamically constructs an abstract-syntax representation, which is eventually passed to a semantics-defining back end implemented by the EDSL author.},

In particular, the classic flow equations for bit-vector-based d.f.a.s reformat trivially into modal mu-calculus formulas. A surprising consequence is that two of the classical d.f.a.s are exposed as unsound; this problem is analyzed and simply repaired. In the process of making the above discoveries, we cIarify the relationship between a.i. and d.f.a. in terms of the often-misunderstood notion of collecting semantics and we highlight how the research areas of flow analysis, abstract interpretation, and model checking have grown together.},

  abstract = {The root cause for confidentiality and integrity attacks against computing systems is insecure information flow. The complexity of modern systems poses a major challenge to secure end-to-end information flow, ensuring that the insecurity of a single component does not render the entire system insecure. While information flow in a variety of languages and settings has been thoroughly studied in isolation, the problem of tracking information across component boundaries has been largely out of reach of the work so far. This is unsatisfactory because tracking information across component boundaries is necessary for end-to-end security. This paper proposes a framework for uniform tracking of information flow through both the application and the underlying database. Key enabler of the uniform treatment is recent work by Cheney et al., which studies database manipulation via an embedded language-integrated query language (with Microsoft's LINQ on the backend). Because both the host language and the embedded query languages are functional F\#-like languages, we are able to leverage information-flow enforcement for functional languages to obtain information-flow control for databases "for free", synergize it with information-flow control for applications and thus guarantee security across application-database boundaries. We develop the formal results in the form of a security type system that includes a treatment of algebraic data types and pattern matching, and establish its soundness. On the practical side, we implement the framework and demonstrate its usefulness in a case study with a realistic movie rental database.},

Both aspects of proof-theoreticsemantics can be intertwined, i.e. the semantics of proofs is itselfoften given in terms of proofs., Proof-theoretic semantics has several roots, the most specific onebeing Gentzen's remarks that the introduction rules in hiscalculus of natural deduction define the meanings of logical constants,while the elimination rules can be obtained as a consequence of thisdefinition (see section 2.2.1). Morebroadly, it belongs to what Prawitz called general prooftheory (see section 1.1). Even morebroadly, it is part of the tradition according to which the meaning ofa term should be explained by reference to the way it is usedin our language., Within philosophy, proof-theoretic semantics has mostly figuredunder the heading ``theory of meaning''. This terminologyfollows Dummett, who claimed that the theory of meaning is the basis oftheoretical philosophy, a view which he attributed to Frege.

It turns out that taking shift0 rather than shift as the basis for the family of control operators is essential for this. Our source language is a typed embedding in the dependently typed language Idris. Our target language is a HOAS embedding in Idris. The translation avoids administrative beta- and eta-redexes at all levels of the CPS hierarchy, by iterating well-known techniques for the non-iterated CPS translation.},

Building on work by Ahmed, Appel and others, we introduce a step-indexed semantics for the imperative object calculus of Abadi and Cardelli. Providing a semantic account of this calculus using more `traditional', domain-theoretic approaches has proved challenging due to the combination of dynamically allocated objects, higher-order store, and an expressive type system. Here we show that, using step-indexing, one can interpret a rich type discipline with object types, subtyping, recursive and bounded quantified types in the presence of state.},

In the functional programming community monads are known to offer a convenient and elegant abstraction for programming with probability distributions, but their use is often limited to very simple inference problems. We show that it is possible to use the monad abstraction to construct probabilistic models for machine learning, while still offering good performance of inference in challenging models. We use a GADT as an underlying representation of a probability distribution and apply Sequential Monte Carlo-based methods to achieve efficient inference. We define a formal semantics via measure theory. We demonstrate a clean and elegant implementation that achieves performance comparable with Anglican, a state-of-the-art probabilistic programming system.},

The technique is not specific to monads, and we show how it can also be applied to other structures, such as applicative functors. One significant use case for this technique is domain-specific languages, where it is often desirable to compile a deep embedding of a computation to some other language, which requires restricting the types that can appear in that computation.},

In such a category, the notion of a `generalized set', for example an `A-indexed set', is represented by a morphism B \textrightarrow{} A of C, i.e. by an object of C/A. The point about such a category C is that C is a C-indexed category, and more, is a hyper-doctrine, so that it has a full first order logic associated with it. This logic has some peculiar aspects. For instance, the types are the objects of C and the terms are the morphisms of C. For a given type A, the predicates with a free variable of type A are morphisms into A, and `proofs' are morphisms over A. We see here a certain `ambiguity' between the notions of type, predicate, and term, of object and proof: a term of type A is a morphism into A, which is a predicate over A; a morphism 1 \textrightarrow{} A can be viewed either as an object of type A or as a proof of the proposition A.},

Initialisation should be safe (so that programs can never suffer null pointer exceptions or otherwise observe uninitialised values) and modular (so that each part of the circular structure can be written and compiled separately). Unfortunately, existing languages do not support modular circular initialisation: programmers in practical languages resort to Tony Hoare's ``Billion Dollar Mistake'': initialising variables with nulls, and then hoping to fix them up afterward. While recent research languages have offered some solutions, none fully support safe modular circular initialisation.We present placeholders, a straightforward extension to object-oriented languages that describes circular structures simply, directly, and modularly. In typed languages, placeholders can be described by placeholder types that ensure placeholders are used safely. We define an operational semantics for placeholders, a type system for placeholder types, and prove soundness. Incorporating placeholders into object-oriented languages should make programs simultaneously simpler to write, and easier to write correctly.},

In this paper, we compile nested pattern and copattern matching into a core language which only supports simple non-nested (co)pattern matching. This core language may serve as an intermediate language of a compiler. We show that this translation is conservative, i.e. the multi-step reduction relation in both languages coincides for terms of the original language. Furthermore, we show that the translation preserves strong and weak normalisation: a term of the original language is strongly/weakly normalising in one language if and only if it is so in the other. In the proof we develop more general criteria which guarantee that extensions of abstract reduction systems are conservative and preserve strong or weak normalisation.},

  abstract = {We investigate the interplay between two modalities for controlling the behaviour of recursive functional programs on infinite structures which are completely silent in the syntax. The latter means that programs do not contain "marks" showing the application of the introduction and elimination rules for the modalities. This shifts the burden of controlling recursion from the programmer to the compiler. To do this, we introduce a typed lambda calculus a la Curry with two silent modalities and guarded recursive types. The first modality delays the data while the second one removes the delays. The typing discipline guarantees normalisation and can be transformed into an algorithm which infers the type of a program.},

Most dependently-typed languages automatically use equalities that follow from beta-reduction during type checking; however, such reasoning is incompatible with congruence closure. In contrast, Zombie does not use automatic beta-reduction because types may contain potentially diverging terms. Therefore Zombie provides a unique opportunity to explore an alternative definition of equivalence in dependently-typed language design. Our work includes the specification of the language via a bidirectional type system, which works "up-to-congruence,'' and an algorithm for elaborating expressions in this language to an explicitly typed core language. We prove that our elaboration algorithm is complete with respect to the source type system, and always produces well typed terms in the core language.

Abstraction mechanisms, however, along with simplicity, introduce also execution overhead and often lead to significant performance degradation. Avoiding abstractions in favor of performance, on the other hand, increases code complexity and cost of maintenance. We develop a systematic approach and formalized framework for implementing software components with a first-class specialization capability. We show how to extend a higher-order functional language with abstraction mechanisms carefully designed to provide automatic and guaranteed elimination of abstraction overhead. We propose staged evaluation as a new method of program staging and show how it can be implemented as zipper-based traversal of program terms where one-hole contexts are generically constructed from the abstract syntax of the language. We show how generic programming techniques together with staged evaluation lead to a very simple yet powerful method of isomorphic specialization which utilizes first-class definitions of isomorphisms between data types to provide guarantee of abstraction elimination. We give a formalized description of the isomorphic specialization algorithm and show how it can be implemented as a set of term rewriting rules using active patterns and staged evaluation. We implemented our approach as a generic programming framework with first-class staging, term rewriting and isomorphic specialization and show in our evaluation that the proposed capabilities give rise to a new paradigm to develop domain-specific software components without abstraction penalty.},

  abstract = {High-level programming languages play a key role in a growing number of networking platforms, streamlining application development and enabling precise formal reasoning about network behavior. Unfortunately, current compilers only handle "local" programs that specify behavior in terms of hop-by-hop forwarding behavior, or modest extensions such as simple paths. To encode richer "global" behaviors, programmers must add extra state -- something that is tricky to get right and makes programs harder to write and maintain. Making matters worse, existing compilers can take tens of minutes to generate the forwarding state for the network, even on relatively small inputs. This forces programmers to waste time working around performance issues or even revert to using hardware-level APIs. This paper presents a new compiler for the NetKAT language that handles rich features including regular paths and virtual networks, and yet is several orders of magnitude faster than previous compilers. The compiler uses symbolic automata to calculate the extra state needed to implement "global" programs, and an intermediate representation based on binary decision diagrams to dramatically improve performance. We describe the design and implementation of three essential compiler stages: from virtual programs (which specify behavior in terms of virtual topologies) to global programs (which specify network-wide behavior in terms of physical topologies), from global programs to local programs (which specify behavior in terms of single-switch behavior), and from local programs to hardware-level forwarding tables. We present results from experiments on real-world benchmarks that quantify performance in terms of compilation time and forwarding table size.},

  abstract = {Selecting operations based on the run-time type of an object is key to many object-oriented and functional programming techniques. We present a technique for implementing open and efficient type switching on hierarchical extensible data types. The technique is general and copes well with C++ multiple inheritance. To simplify experimentation and gain realistic performance using production-quality compilers and tool chains, we implement a type switch construct as an ISO C++11 library, called Mach7. This library-only implementation provides concise notation and outperforms the visitor design pattern, commonly used for case analysis on types in object-oriented programming. For closed sets of types, its performance roughly equals equivalent code in functional languages, such as OCaml and Haskell. The type-switching code is easier to use and is more expressive than hand-coded visitors are. The library is non-intrusive and circumvents most of the extensibility restrictions typical of the visitor design pattern. It was motivated by applications involving large, typed, abstract syntax trees.},

River builds on Brooklet by addressing the real-world details that the calculus elides. We evaluated our system by implementing front-ends for three streaming languages, and three important optimizations, and a back-end for the System S distributed streaming runtime.

We have implemented the compilation to C; it yields a performance comparable to that of other modern Scheme-to-C compilers. In addition, we have integrated various optimizations such as constant propagation, higher-order removal, and arity raising simply by modifying the underlying interpreter. Purely first-order methods suffice to achieve the transformations. Our approach is an instance of semantics-directed compiler generation.},

The composition is an application of deforestation or fusion.The result is a run-time code generation system built from existing components. Its applications are numerous.

To relieve users from so-produced boilerplate, the Autosubst framework automates working with de Bruijn terms: For each annotated inductive type, Autosubst generates a corresponding instantiation operation for parallel substitutions and a decision procedure for assumption-free substitution lemmas. However, Autosubst is implemented in Ltac, Coq's tactic language, and thus suffers from Ltac's limitations. In particular, Autosubst is restricted to Coq and unscoped, non-mutual inductive types with a single sort of variables. In this paper, we present a new version of Autosubst that overcomes these restrictions. Autosubst 2 is an external code generator, which translates second-order HOAS specifications into potentially mutual inductive term sorts. We extend the equational theory of Autosubst to the case of mutual inductive sorts by combining the application of multiple parallel substitutions into exactly one instantiation operation for each sort, i.e. we parallelise substitutions to vector substitutions. The resulting equational theory is both simpler and more expressive than that of the original Autosubst framework and allows us to present an even more elegant proof of part A of the POPLMark challenge.},

Now that the conference on Lisp and Functional Programming has become ICFP, some may think that OCaml and Haskell programmers have inherited this (now undeserved) epigram. I do believe that as multicore processors are becoming prominent, and soon ubiquitous, it behooves all programmers to rethink their programming style, strategies, and tactics, so that their code may have excellent performance. For the last six years I have been part of a team working on a programming language, Fortress, that has borrowed ideas not only from Fortran, not only from Java, not only from Algol and Alphard and CLU, not only from MADCAP and MODCAP and MIRFAC and the Klerer-May system-but also from Haskell, and I would like to repay the favor. In this talk I will discuss three ideas (none original with me) that I have found to be especially powerful in organizing Fortress programs so that they may be executed equally effectively either sequentially or in parallel: user-defined associative operators (and, more generally, user-defined monoids); conjugate transforms of data; and monoid-caching trees (as described, for example, by Hinze and Paterson). I will exhibit pleasant little code examples (some original with me) that make use of these ideas.},

The first is a type system for describing a universally valid storage shape graph for a program in linear space.

While this syntax barrier is known to exist, whether and how it varies across programming languages has not been carefully investigated. For this article, we conducted four empirical studies on programming language syntax as part of a larger analysis into the, so called, programming language wars. We first present two surveys conducted with students on the intuitiveness of syntax, which we used to garner formative clues on what words and symbols might be easy for novices to understand. We followed up with two studies on the accuracy rates of novices using a total of six programming languages: Ruby, Java, Perl, Python, Randomo, and Quorum. Randomo was designed by randomly choosing some keywords from the ASCII table (a metaphorical placebo). To our surprise, we found that languages using a more traditional C-style syntax (both Perl and Java) did not afford accuracy rates significantly higher than a language with randomly generated keywords, but that languages which deviate (Quorum, Python, and Ruby) did. These results, including the specifics of syntax that are particularly problematic for novices, may help teachers of introductory programming courses in choosing appropriate first languages and in helping students to overcome the challenges they face with syntax.},

These parallel systems exhibit tremendous computational power at the cost of increased programming effort resulting in a tension between performance and code portability. Typically, code is either tuned in a low-level imperative language using hardware-specific optimizations to achieve maximum performance or is written in a high-level, possibly functional, language to achieve portability at the expense of performance. We propose a novel approach aiming to combine high-level programming, code portability, and high-performance. Starting from a high-level functional expression we apply a simple set of rewrite rules to transform it into a low-level functional representation, close to the OpenCL programming model, from which OpenCL code is generated. Our rewrite rules define a space of possible implementations which we automatically explore to generate hardware-specific OpenCL implementations. We formalize our system with a core dependently-typed lambda-calculus along with a denotational semantics which we use to prove the correctness of the rewrite rules. We test our design in practice by implementing a compiler which generates high performance imperative OpenCL code. Our experiments show that we can automatically derive hardware-specific implementations from simple functional high-level algorithmic expressions offering performance on a par with highly tuned code for multicore CPUs and GPUs written by experts.},

The most popular type-level programming extension is TypeFamilies, which allows users to write functions on types. Yet, using type functions can cripple type inference in certain situations. In particular, lack of injectivity in type functions means that GHC can never infer an instantiation of a type variable appearing only under type functions. In this paper, we describe a small modification to GHC that allows type functions to be annotated as injective. GHC naturally must check validity of the injectivity annotations. The algorithm to do so is surprisingly subtle. We prove soundness for a simplification of our algorithm, and state and prove a completeness property, though the algorithm is not fully complete. As much of our reasoning surrounds functions defined by a simple pattern-matching structure, we believe our results extend beyond just Haskell. We have implemented our solution on a branch of GHC and plan to make it available to regular users with the next stable release of the compiler.},

  abstract = {Work on the TILT compiler for Standard ML led us to study a language with singleton kinds: S(A) is the kind of all types provably equivalent to the type A. Singletons are interesting because they provide a very general form of definitions for type variables, allow fine-grained control of type computations, and allow many equational constraints to be expressed within the type system.
Internally, TILT represents programs using a predicative variant of Girard's F\&ohgr; enriched with singleton kinds, dependent product and function kinds (\&Sgr; and \&Pgr;), and a sub-kinding relation. An important benefit of using a typed language as the representation of programs is that typechecking can detect many common compiler implementation errors. However, the decidability of typechecking for our particular representation is not obvious. In order to typecheck a term, we must be able to determine whether two type constructors are provably equivalent. But in the presence of singleton kinds, the equivalence of type constructors depends both on the typing context in which they are compared and on the kind at which they are compared.
In this paper we concentrate on the key issue for decidability of typechecking: determining the equivalence of well-formed type constructors. We define the \&lgr;\&Pgr;\&Sgr;S{$<$} calculus, a model of the constructors and kinds of TILT's intermediate language. Inspired by Coquand's result for type theory, we prove decidability of constructor equivalence for \&lgr;\&Pgr;\&Sgr;S{$\leq$} by exhibiting a novel \textemdash{} though slightly inefficient \textemdash{} type-directed comparison algorithm. The correctness of this algorithm is proved using an interesting variant of Kripke-style logical relations: unary relations are indexed by a single possible world (in our case, a typing context), but binary relations are indexed by two worlds. Using this result we can then show the correctness of a natural, practical algorithm used by the TILT compiler.},

But in the presence of singleton types, the provability of an equivalence judgment {$\Gamma$} {$\vdash$} M1 \&eqiv;M2 : A can depend both on the typing context {$\Gamma$} and on the particular type A at which M1 and M2 are compared.We show how to prove decidability of term equivalence, hence of type checking, in \&lamda;{$\Pi\Sigma$}S{$\leq$} by exhibiting a type-directed algorithm for directly computing normal forms. The correctness of normalization is shown using an unusual variant of Kripke logical relations organized around sets; rather than defining a logical equivalence relation, we work directly with (subsets of) the corresponding equivalence classes.We then provide a more efficient algorithm for checking type equivalence without constructing normal forms. We also show that type checking, subtyping, and all other judgments of the system are decidable.The \&lamda;{$\Pi\Sigma$}S{$\leq$} calculus models type constructors and kinds in the intermediate language used by the TILT compiler for Standard ML to implement the SML module system. The decidability of \&lamda;{$\Pi\Sigma$}S{$\leq$} term equivalence allows us to show decidability of type checking for TILT's intermediate language. We also obtain a consistency result that allows us to prove type safety for the intermediate language. The algorithms derived here form the core of the type checker used for internal type checking in TILT.},

In particular, we show how to solve recursive type equations involving dependent types. We propose that the internal logic of S provides the right setting for the synthetic construction of abstract versions of step-indexed models of programming languages and program logics. As an example, we show how to construct a model of a programming language with higher-order store and recursive types entirely inside the internal logic of S. Moreover, we give an axiomatic categorical treatment of models of synthetic guarded domain theory and prove that, for any complete Heyting algebra A with a well-founded basis, the topos of sheaves over A forms a model of synthetic guarded domain theory, generalizing the results for S.},

Thus, changes to the program can invalidate the choice of collections, making code evolution costly. It would be desirable to have a collection that performs well for a broad range of operations. To this end, we present the RRB-Vector, an immutable sequence collection that offers good performance across a large number of sequential and parallel operations. The underlying innovations are: (1) the Relaxed-Radix-Balanced (RRB) tree structure, which allows efficient structural reorganization, and (2) an optimization that exploits spatio-temporal locality on the RRB data structure in order to offset the cost of traversing the tree. In our benchmarks, the RRB-Vector speedup for parallel operations is lower bounded by 7x when executing on 4 CPUs of 8 cores each. The performance for discrete operations, such as appending on either end, or updating and removing elements, is consistently good and compares favorably to the most important immutable sequence collections in the literature and in use today. The memory footprint of RRB-Vector is on par with arrays and an order of magnitude less than competing collections.},

  abstract = {Modern, statically typed programming languages provide various abstraction facilities at both the term- and type-level. Common abstraction mechanisms for types include parametric polymorphism -- a hallmark of functional languages -- and subtyping -- which is pervasive in object-oriented languages. Additionally, both kinds of languages may allow parametrized (or generic) datatype definitions in modules or classes. When several of these features are present in the same language, new and more expressive combinations arise, such as (1) bounded quantification, (2) bounded operator abstractions and (3) translucent type definitions. An example of such a language is Scala, which features all three of the aforementioned type-level constructs. This increases the expressivity of the language, but also the complexity of its type system. From a theoretical point of view, the various abstraction mechanisms have been studied through different extensions of Girard's higher-order polymorphic lambda-calculus F-omega. Higher-order subtyping and bounded polymorphism (1 and 2) have been formalized in F-omega-sub and its many variants; type definitions of various degrees of opacity (3) have been formalized through extensions of F-omega with singleton types. In this dissertation, I propose type intervals as a unifying concept for expressing (1--3) and other related constructs. In particular, I develop an extension of F-omega with interval kinds as a formal theory of higher-order subtyping with type intervals, and show how the familiar concepts of higher-order bounded quantification, bounded operator abstraction and singleton kinds can all be encoded in a semantics-preserving way using interval kinds. Going beyond the status quo, the theory is expressive enough to also cover less familiar constructs, such as lower-bounded operator abstractions and first-class, higher-order inequality constraints. I establish basic metatheoretic properties of the theory: I prove that subject reduction holds for well-kinded types w.r.t. full beta-reduction, that types and kinds are weakly normalizing, and that the theory is type safe w.r.t. its call-by-value operational reduction semantics. Key to this metatheoretic development is the use of hereditary substitution and the definition of an equivalent, canonical presentation of subtyping, which involves only normal types and kinds. The resulting metatheory is entirely syntactic, i.e. does not involve any model constructions, and has been fully mechanized in Agda. The extension of F-omega with interval kinds constitutes a stepping stone to the development of a higher-order version of the calculus of Dependent Object Types (DOT) -- the theoretical foundation of Scala's type system. In the last part of this dissertation, I briefly sketch a possible extension of the theory toward this goal and discuss some of the challenges involved in adapting the existing metatheory to that extension.

Modern constructive type theory is based on pure dependently typed lambda calculus, augmented with user-defined datatypes. This paper presents an alternative called the Calculus of Dependent Lambda Eliminations, based on pure lambda encodings with no auxiliary datatype system. New typing constructs are defined that enable induction, as well as large eliminations with lambda encodings. These constructs are constructor-constrained recursive types, and a lifting operation to lift simply typed terms to the type level. Using a lattice-theoretic denotational semantics for types, the language is proved logically consistent. The power of CDLE is demonstrated through several examples, which have been checked with a prototype implementation called Cedille.},

It is typically not possible to write a single application that can run efficiently in different environments, leading to multiple versions and increased complexity. Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs) are a promising avenue to enable programmers to use high-level abstractions and still achieve good performance on a variety of hardware. This is possible because DSLs have higher-level semantics and restrictions than general-purpose languages, so DSL compilers can perform higher-level optimization and translation. However, the cost of developing performance-oriented DSLs is a substantial roadblock to their development and adoption. In this article, we present an overview of the Delite compiler framework and the DSLs that have been developed with it. Delite simplifies the process of DSL development by providing common components, like parallel patterns, optimizations, and code generators, that can be reused in DSL implementations. Delite DSLs are embedded in Scala, a general-purpose programming language, but use metaprogramming to construct an Intermediate Representation (IR) of user programs and compile to multiple languages (including C++, CUDA, and OpenCL). DSL programs are automatically parallelized and different parts of the application can run simultaneously on CPUs and GPUs. We present Delite DSLs for machine learning, data querying, graph analysis, and scientific computing and show that they all achieve performance competitive to or exceeding C++ code.},

These invariants are then implicitly assumed by the rest of the implementation, for instance, to ensure that a field may be safely dereferenced or that immutable data may be accessed concurrently. Consequently, letting an object escape from its constructor is dangerous; the escaping object might not yet satisfy its invariants, leading to errors in code that relies on them. Nevertheless, preventing objects entirely from escaping from their constructors is too restrictive; it is often useful to call auxiliary methods on the object under initialisation or to pass it to another constructor to set up mutually-recursive structures. We present a type system that tracks which objects are fully initialised and which are still under initialisation. The system can be used to prevent objects from escaping, but also to allow safe escaping by making explicit which objects might not yet satisfy their invariants. We designed, formalised and implemented our system as an extension to a non-null type system, but it is not limited to this application. Our system is conceptually simple and requires little annotation overhead; it is sound and sufficiently expressive for many common programming idioms. Therefore, we believe it to be the first such system suitable for mainstream use.},

The eventually produced SQL is ensured to be well-formed and well-typed, and hence free from the embarrassing (security) problems. Language-integrated query takes advantage of the host language's functional and modular abstractions to compose and reuse queries and build query libraries. Furthermore, language-integrated query systems like T-LINQ generate efficient SQL, by applying a number of program transformations to the embedded query. Alas, the set of transformation rules is not designed to be extensible. We demonstrate a new technique of integrating database queries into a typed functional programming language, so to write well-typed, composable queries and execute them efficiently on any SQL back-end as well as on an in-memory noSQL store. A distinct feature of our framework is that both the query language as well as the transformation rules needed to generate efficient SQL are safely user-extensible, to account for many variations in the SQL back-ends, as well for domain-specific knowledge. The transformation rules are guaranteed to be type-preserving and hygienic by their very construction. They can be built from separately developed and reusable parts and arbitrarily composed into optimization pipelines. With this technique we have embedded into OCaml a relational query language that supports a very large subset of SQL including grouping and aggregation. Its types cover the complete set of intricate SQL behaviors.},

In particular it helps keeping the deep embedding small and it makes extending the embedded language much easier. Our technique also has some unexpected but welcome knock-on effects.

In this paper, building on the recently developed Iris framework for concurrent separation logic, we develop OCPL, the first program logic for compositionally specifying and verifying OCPs in a language with closures, mutable state, and concurrency. The key idea of OCPL is to account for the interface between verified and untrusted code by adopting a well-known idea from the literature on security protocol verification, namely robust safety. Programs that export only properly wrapped values to their environment can be proven robustly safe, meaning that their untrusted environment cannot violate their internal invariants.

We explain why, even in the presence of automatic binding time analysis, explicit annotations are useful, especially for programs with more than two stages.A thesis of this paper is that multi-stage languages are useful as programming languages in their own right, and should support features that make it possible for programmers to write staged computations without significantly changing their normal programming style. To illustrate this we provide a simple three stage example, and an extended two-stage example elaborating a number of practical issues.},

  abstract = {We introduce MetaML, a practically motivated, statically typed multi-stage programming language. MetaML is a ``real'' language. We have built an implementation and used it to solve multi-stage problems. MetaML allows the programmer to construct, combine, and execute code fragments in a type-safe manner. Code fragments can contain free variables, but they obey the static-scoping principle. MetaML performs type-checking for all stages once and for all before the execution of the first stage. Certain anomalies with our first MetaML implementation led us to formalize an illustrative subset of the MetaML implementation. We present both a big-step semantics and type system for this subset, and prove the type system's soundness with respect to a big-step semantics. From a software engineering point of view, this means that generators written in the MetaML subset never generate unsafe programs. A type system and semantics for full MetaML is still ongoing work. We argue that multi-stage languages are useful as programming languages in their own right, that they supply a sound basis for high-level program generation technology, and that they should support features that make it possible for programmers to write staged computations without significantly changing their normal programming style. To illustrate this we provide a simple three-stage example elaborating a number of practical issues. The design of MetaML was based on two main principles that we identified as fundamental for high-level program generation, namely, cross-stage persistence and cross-stage safety. We present these principles, explain the technical problems they give rise to, and how we address with these problems in our implementation.},

In the research community, there is an ongoing debate about the best way to architect such query compilers. This is perceived to be a difficult task, requiring techniques fundamentally different from traditional interpreted query execution.   We aim to contribute to this discussion by drawing attention to an old but underappreciated idea known as Futamura projections, which fundamentally link interpreters and compilers. Guided by this idea, we demonstrate that efficient query compilation can actually be very simple, using techniques that are no more difficult than writing a query interpreter in a high-level language. Moreover, we demonstrate how intricate compilation patterns that were previously used to justify multiple compiler passes can be realized in one single, straightforward, generation pass. Key examples are injection of specialized index structures, data representation changes such as string dictionaries, and various kinds of code motion to reduce the amount of work on the critical path.  We present LB2: a high-level query compiler developed in this style that performs on par with, and sometimes beats, the best compiled query engines on the standard TPC-H benchmark.},

We believed that existing SML compilers were doing a good job of conventional functional language optimizations, as one might find in a LISP compiler, but that inadequate use was made of the rich type information present in the source language. Our goal was to show that we could get much greater performance by propagating type information through to the back end of the compiler, without sacrificing the advantages afforded by loop-oriented and other optimizations.We also confirmed that using typed intermediate languages dramatically improved the reliability and maintainability of the compiler itself. In particular, we were able to use the type system to express critical invariants, and enforce those invariants through type checking. In this respect, TIL introduced and popularized the notion of a certifying compiler, which attaches a checkable certificate of safety to its generated code. In turn, this led directly to the idea of certified object code, inspiring the development of Proof-Carrying Code and Typed Assembly Language as certified object code formats.},

Our technique therefore uses these proofs, which can be produced by translation validation or a proof-carrying compiler, as a guide to generalize the original and transformed programs into broadly applicable optimization rules. We present a category-theoretic formalization of our proof generalization technique. This abstraction makes our technique applicable to logics besides our own. In particular, we demonstrate how our technique can also be used to learn query optimizations for relational databases or to aid programmers in debugging type errors. Finally, we show experimentally that our technique enables programmers to train a compiler with application-specific optimizations by providing concrete examples of original programs and the desired transformed programs. We also show how it enables a compiler to learn efficient-to-run optimizations from expensive-to-run super-optimizers.},

For example, there are no known sound and complete algorithms for subtyping (and consequently type checking) Java wildcards, and in fact subtyping is suspected to be undecidable because wildcards are a form of bounded existential types. Furthermore, some Java types with wildcards have no joins, making inference of type arguments for generic methods particularly difficult. Although there has been progress on these fronts, we have identified significant shortcomings of the current state of the art, along with new problems that have not been addressed. In this paper, we illustrate how these shortcomings reflect the subtle complexity of the problem domain, and then present major improvements to the current algorithms for wildcards by making slight restrictions on the usage of wildcards. Our survey of existing Java programs suggests that realistic code should already satisfy our restrictions without any modifications. We present a simple algorithm for subtyping which is both sound and complete with our restrictions, an algorithm for lazily joining types with wildcards which addresses some of the shortcomings of prior work, and techniques for improving the Java type system as a whole. Lastly, we describe various extensions to wildcards that would be compatible with our algorithms.},

They ease the construction of programs by using satisfiability solvers to automate tasks such as verification, debugging, synthesis, and non-deterministic execution. But reducing programming tasks to satisfiability problems involves translating programs to logical constraints, which is an engineering challenge even for domain-specific languages. We have previously shown that translation to constraints can be avoided if SDSLs are implemented by (traditional) embedding into a host language that is itself solver-aided. This paper describes how to implement a symbolic virtual machine (SVM) for such a host language. Our symbolic virtual machine is lightweight because it compiles to constraints only a small subset of the host's constructs, while allowing SDSL designers to use the entire language, including constructs for DSL embedding. This lightweight compilation employs a novel symbolic execution technique with two key properties: it produces compact encodings, and it enables concrete evaluation to strip away host constructs that are outside the subset compilable to constraints. Our symbolic virtual machine architecture is at the heart of Rosette, a solver-aided language that is host to several new SDSLs.},

In addition, a limiting factor in the adoption of effect systems is their unsuitability for localized and customized effect disciplines. This paper addresses these issues by presenting the first implementation of gradual effect checking, for Scala, which supports both effect polymorphism and a domain-specific language called Effscript to declaratively define and customize effect disciplines. We report on the theory, implementation, and practical application of the system.},

To demonstrate the level of expressiveness that can be achieved, we will bring a compiler frontend that accepts queries embedded into the Haskell programming language. Compilation via flattening takes places in a series of simple steps all of which will be made tangible by the demonstration. The final output is a program of lifted primitive operations which existing query engines can efficiently implement.

We implement our approach as a framework for writing verified distributed programs in Go and evaluate it with four challenging case studies\textemdash{} the classic two-phase commit protocol, the Raft leader election protocol, single-decree Paxos protocol, and a Multi-Paxos based distributed key-value store.

However, previous work on scope graphs has been limited to simple, nominal type systems. In this paper, we show that viewing scopes as types enables us to model the internal structure of types in a range of non-simple type systems (including structural records and generic classes) using the generic representation of scopes. Further, we show that relations between such types can be expressed in terms of generalized scope graph queries. We extend scope graphs with scoped relations and queries. We introduce Statix, a new domain-specific meta-language for the specification of static semantics, based on scope graphs and constraints. We evaluate the scopes as types approach and the Statix design in case studies of the simply-typed lambda calculus with records, System F, and Featherweight Generic Java.},

The program ignores the actual structure of the data stored in the files, hence it might generate spurious conflicts, which must be manually resolved by the user. In this paper, we present a state-based, three-way, persistent, data-type generic diff3 algorithm whose increased precision in detecting changes reduces the number of false conflicts raised and improves its merging capabilities. We have implemented the algorithm in Agda, a proof assistant with dependent types, and developed a model to reason about ``diffing'' and merging. We have formalized sanity properties and specifications of diff3 and proved that our algorithm meets them. Furthermore, we have identified the minimal conditions under which the merging algorithm raises a conflict and established a structural invariant preserved.},

The key idea is to reflect the code implementing a user-defined function into the function's (output) refinement type. As a consequence, at uses of the function, the function definition is instantiated in the SMT logic in a precise fashion that permits decidable verification. Reflection allows the user to write equational proofs of programs just by writing other programs using pattern-matching and recursion to perform case-splitting and induction. Thus, via the propositions-as-types principle, we show that reflection permits the specification of arbitrary functional correctness properties. Finally, we introduce a proof-search algorithm called Proof by Logical Evaluation that uses techniques from model checking and abstract interpretation, to completely automate equational reasoning. We have implemented reflection in Liquid Haskell and used it to verify that the widely used instances of the Monoid, Applicative, Functor, and Monad typeclasses actually satisfy key algebraic laws required to make the clients safe, and have used reflection to build the first library that actually verifies assumptions about associativity and ordering that are crucial for safe deterministic parallelism.},

We propose a novel approach to behavioral reflection that eliminates the barrier between applications and the VM by manipulating an explicit tower of first-class interpreters. Pinocchio is a proof-of-concept implementation of our approach which enables radical changes to the interpretation of programs by explicitly instantiating subclasses of the base interpreter. We illustrate the design of Pinocchio through non-trivial examples that extend runtime semantics to support debugging, parallel debugging, and back-in-time object-flow debugging. Although performance is not yet addressed, we also discuss numerous opportunities for optimization, which we believe will lead to a practical approach to behavioral reflection.},

Valid transformations on program terms can be described by a set of rewrite rules; rewriting strategies are used to describe when and how the various rules should be applied in order to obtain the desired optimization effects. Separating rules from strategies in this fashion makes it easier to reason about the behavior of the optimizer as a whole, compared to traditional monolithic optimizer implementations. We illustrate the expressiveness of our language by using it to describe a simple optimizer for an ML-like intermediate representation.The basic strategy language uses operators such as sequential composition, choice, and recursion to build transformers from a set of labeled unconditional rewrite rules. We also define an extended language in which the side-conditions and contextual rules that arise in realistic optimizer specifications can themselves be expressed as strategy-driven rewrites. We show that the features of the basic and extended languages can be expressed by breaking down the rewrite rules into their primitive building blocks, namely matching and building terms in variable binding environments. This gives us a low-level core language which has a clear semantics, can be implemented straightforwardly and can itself be optimized. The current implementation generates C code from a strategy specification.},

  abstract = {Program transformation is used in many areas of software engineering. Examples include compilation, optimization, synthesis, refactoring, migration, normalization and improvement [15]. Rewrite rules are a natural formalism for expressing single program transformations. However, using a standard strategy for normalizing a program with a set of rewrite rules is not adequate for implementing program transformation systems. It may be necessary to apply a rule only in some phase of a transformation, to apply rules in some order, or to apply a rule only to part of a program. These restrictions may be necessary to avoid non-termination or to choose a specific path in a non-con uent rewrite system. Stratego is a language for the specification of program transformation systems based on the paradigm of rewriting strategies. It supports the separation of strategies from transformation rules, thus allowing careful control over the application of these rules. As a result of this separation, transformation rules are reusable in multiple difierent transformations and generic strategies capturing patterns of control can be described independently of the transformation rules they apply. Such strategies can even be formulated independently of the object language by means of the generic term traversal capabilities of Stratego. In this short paper I give a description of version 0.5 of the Stratego system, discussing the features of the language (Section 2), the library (Section 3), the compiler (Section 4) and some of the applications that have been built (Section 5).

  abstract = {For many programmers, the notion of ``pattern matching'' evokes nothing more than regular expressions for matching unstructured text, or technologies such as XPath to match semi-structured data in XML. This common perception of pattern matching is partly due to the success of regular expressions and XPath, which are supported in many popular programming languages today, either as standard libraries or as part of the language. But it is also due to the fact that many programmers never used another elegant form of pattern matching\textemdash{}on structured data, i.e., the native data structures of a programming language. This form of matching is common in functional or logic languages used in the research, but unfortunately much less used in the software industry. It is indeed very surprising that none of the popular languages in use today support, in their standard form, a nearly general form of structured data matching, decades after this technology has been discovered and continuously improved. This paper shows that programmers do not have to wait for next generation languages to integrate pattern matching, neither need they use non-standard pre-processors, thereby losing some advantages that are most important in an industrial setting: official support, compatibility, standardization, etc. Instead, pattern matching of native data in custom notations can be implemented as a minimalist library in popular object languages. Thus, some of the comfortable existing notations from logic languages can be reused, existing standard notations for structured data such as JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) can be smoothly extended to support pattern matching, and new notations can be designed. As in most library implementations of regular expressions, custom notation patterns are simply represented as strings. They can be used in two different modes: interpreted and compiled. This paper presents two open-source implementations of custom matching notations, for Java and JavaScript, exhibiting a reasonable overhead compared to other forms of pattern matching.},

He called this kind of knowledgereflection. Smith proposed a programming language, called 3-LISP, which embodied such self-knowledge in the domain of metacircular interpreters. Every 3-LISP program is interpreted by a metacircular interpreter, also written in 3-LISP. This gives rise to a picture of an infinite tower of metacircular interpreters, each being interpreted by the one above it. Such a metaphor poses a serious challenge for conventional modes of understanding of programming languages. In our earlier work on reflection [4], we showed how a useful species of reflection could be modeled without the use of towers. In this paper, we give a semantic account of the reflective tower. This account is self-contained in the sense that it does not employ reflection to explain reflection.},

This paper presents a modification to the memoization mechanism used by packrat parser implementations that makes it possible for them to support (even indirectly or mutually) left-recursive rules. While it is possible for a packrat parser with our modification to yield super-linear parse times for some left-recursive grammars, our experimentsshow that this is not the case for typical uses of left recursion.},

This separation leads to a tractable notion of definitional equality that identifies computations differing only in the order of execution of independent steps. From a logical point of view our type theory can be seen as a novel combination of lax logic and dual intuitionistic linear logic. An encoding of a small Petri net exemplifies the representation methodology, which can be summarized as ``concurrent computations as monadic expressions''.},

Four increasingly permissive properties of incremental modification realizable by inheritance are examined: behavior compatibility, signature compatibility. name compatibility, and cancellation. Inheritance for entities with finite sets of attributes is defined and characterized as incremental modification with deferred binding of self-reference. Types defined as predicates for type checking are contrasted with classes defined as templates for object generation. Mathematical, operational, and conceptual models of inheritance are then examined in detail, leading to a discussion of algebraic models of behavioral compatibility. horizontal and vertical signature modification, algorithmically defined name modification, additive and subtractive exceptions, abstract inheritance networks, and parametric polymorphism. Liketypes are defined as a symmetrical general form of incremental modification that provide a framework for modeling similarity. The combination of safe behaviorally compatible changes and less safe radical incremental changes in a single programming language is considered.},

Darais et al. apply the same underlying idea to monadic definitional interpreters, and obtain monadic abstract definitional interpreters (ADIs) that perform abstract interpretation in big-step style using monads. Yet, the relation between small-step abstract abstract machines and big-step abstract definitional interpreters is not well studied.   In this paper, we explain their functional correspondence and demonstrate how to systematically transform small-step abstract abstract machines into big-step abstract definitional interpreters. Building on known semantic interderivation techniques from the concrete evaluation setting, the transformations include linearization, lightweight fusion, disentanglement, refunctionalization, and the left inverse of the CPS transform. Linearization expresses nondeterministic choice through first-order data types, after which refunctionalization transforms the first-order data types that represent continuations into higher-order functions. The refunctionalized AAM is an abstract interpreter written in continuation-passing style (CPS) with two layers of continuations, which can be converted back to direct style with delimited control operators. Based on the known correspondence between delimited control and monads, we demonstrate that the explicit use of monads in abstract definitional interpreters is optional.   All transformations properly handle the collecting semantics and nondeterminism of abstract interpretation. Remarkably, we reveal how precise call/return matching in control-flow analysis can be obtained by refunctionalizing a small-step abstract abstract machine with proper caching.},

This extensible proof system forms the foundation for type system extensions such as type families (type-level functions) and Generalized Algebraic Datatypes (GADTs). Such features, in conjunction with kind polymorphism and datatype promotion, support expressive compile-time reasoning. However, the core language lacks explicit kind equality proofs. As a result, type-level computation does not have access to kind-level functions or promoted GADTs, the type-level analogues to expression-level features that have been so useful. In this paper, we eliminate such discrepancies by introducing kind equalities to System FC. Our approach is based on dependent type systems with heterogeneous equality and the "Type-in-Type" axiom, yet it preserves the metatheoretic properties of FC. In particular, type checking is simple, decidable and syntax directed. We prove the preservation and progress theorems for the extended language.},

Unlike simple token substitution macros, such as are provided by CPP (the C preprocessor), syntax macros operate on Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs). Programmable syntax macro systems have not yet been developed for syntactically rich languages such as C because rich concrete syntax requires the manual construction of syntactically valid program fragments, which is a tedious, difficult, and error prone process. Also, using two languages, one for writing the program, and one for writing macros, is another source of complexity. This research solves these problems by having the macro language be a  minimal extension of the programming language, by introducing explicit code template operators into the macro language, and by using a type system to guarantee, at macro definition time, that all macros and macro functions only produce syntactically valid program fragments. The code template operators make the language context sensitive, which requires changes to the parser. The parser must perform type analysis in order to parse macro definitions, or to parse user code that invokes macros.},

  abstract = {Let S be some type system. A typing in S for a typable term M is the collection of all of the information other than M which appears in the final judgement of a proof derivation showing that M is typable. For example, suppose there is a derivation in S ending with the judgement A {$\vdash$} M: {$\tau$} meaning that M has result type {$\tau$} when assuming the types of free variables are given by A. Then (A, {$\tau$}) is a typing for M. A principal typing in S for a term M is a typing for M which somehow represents all other possible typings in S for M. It is important not to confuse this with a weaker notion in connection with the Hindley/Milner type system often called ``principal types''. Previous definitions of principal typings for specific type systems have involved various syntactic operations on typings such as substitution of types for type variables, expansion, lifting, etc. This paper presents a new general definition of principal typings which does not depend on the details of any particular type system. This paper shows that the new general definition correctly generalizes previous system-dependent definitions. This paper explains why the new definition is the right one. Furthermore, the new definition is used to prove that certain polymorphic type systems using {$\forall$}-quantifiers, namely System F and the Hindley/Milner system, do not have principal typings.

The approach easily extends from polymorphic functional languages to imperative languages that provide references, exceptions, continuations, and similar features.

  abstract = {Algebraic effect handlers are a recently popular approach for modelling side-effects that separates the syntax and semantics of effectful operations. The shape of syntax is captured by functors, and free monads over these functors denote syntax trees. The semantics is captured by algebras, and effect handlers pass these over the syntax trees to interpret them into a semantic domain. This approach is inherently modular: different functors can be composed to make trees with richer structure. Such trees are interpreted by applying several handlers in sequence, each removing the syntactic constructs it recognizes. Unfortunately, the construction and traversal of intermediate trees is painfully inefficient and has hindered the adoption of the handler approach. This paper explains how a sequence of handlers can be fused into one, so that multiple tree traversals can be reduced to a single one and no intermediate trees need to be allocated. At the heart of this optimization is keeping the notion of a free monad abstract, thus enabling a change of representation that opens up the possibility of fusion. We demonstrate how the ensuing code can be inlined at compile time to produce efficient handlers.},

We describe a new approach to virtual machine (VM) construction that amortizes much of the effort in initial construction by allowing new languages to be implemented with modest additional effort. The approach relies on abstract syntax tree (AST) interpretation where a node can rewrite itself to a more specialized or more general node, together with an optimizing compiler that exploits the structure of the interpreter. The compiler uses speculative assumptions and deoptimization in order to produce efficient machine code. Our initial experience suggests that high performance is attainable while preserving a modular and layered architecture, and that new high-performance language implementations can be obtained by writing little more than a stylized interpreter.},

The conventional presentation of bi-directional type checking consists of two modes: inference mode and checked mode. In traditional bi-directional type-checking, type annotations are used to guide (via the checked mode) the type inference/checking procedure to determine the type of an expression, and type information flows from functions to arguments.This paper presents a variant of bi-directional type checking where the type information flows from arguments to functions. This variant retains the inference mode, but adds a so-called application mode. Such design can remove annotations that basic bi-directional type checking cannot, and is useful when type information from arguments is required to type-check the functions being applied. We present two applications and develop the meta-theory (mostly verified in Coq) of the application mode.},

Such functions generally perform case analysis on the input types and return values of possibly different types. The goal of our work is to demonstrate how to program with type-indexed values within a Hindley-Milner type system.Our first approach is to interpret an input type as its corresponding value, recursively. This solution is type-safe, in the sense that the ML type system statically prevents any mismatch between the input type and function arguments that depend on this type.Such specific type interpretations, however, prevent us from combining different type-indexed values that share the same type. To meet this objection, we focus on finding a value-independent type encoding that can be shared by different functions. We propose and compare two solutions. One requires first-class and higher-order polymorphism, and, thus, is not implementable in the core language of ML, but it can be programmed using higher-order functors in Standard ML of New Jersey. Its usage, however, is clumsy. The other approach uses embedding/projection functions. It appears to be more practical.We demonstrate the usefulness of type-indexed values through examples including type-directed partial evaluation, C printf-like formatting, and subtype coercions. Finally, we discuss the tradeoffs between our approach and some other solutions based on more expressive typing disciplines.},

A type-indexed family of values is a function that maps a family of types to a family of values. The function performs a case analysis on the input types and returns values of possibly different types. Such a case analysis on types seems to be prohibited by the Hindley\textendash{}Milner type system. Our approaches solve the problem by using type encodings. The compile-time types of the type encodings reflect the types themselves, thereby making the approaches type-safe, in the sense that the underlying type system statically prevents any mismatch between the input type and the function arguments that depend on this type.

A type encoding could be either value-dependent, meaning that the type encoding is tied to a specific type-indexed family, or value-independent, meaning that the type encoding can be shared by various type-indexed families. Our first approach is value-dependent: we simply interpret a type as its corresponding value. Our second approach provides value-independent type encodings through embedding and projection functions; they are universal type interpretations, in that they can be used to compute other type interpretations. We also present an alternative approach to value-independent type encodings, using higher-order functors.

We demonstrate our techniques through applications such as C printf-like formatting, type-directed partial evaluation, and subtype coercions.},

  abstract = {In recent years dependent types have become a hot topic in programming language research. A key reason why dependent types are interesting is that they allow unifying types and terms, which enables both additional expressiveness and economy of concepts. Unfortunately there has been much less work on dependently typed calculi for object-oriented programming. This is partly because it is widely acknowledged that the combination between dependent types and subtyping is particularly challenging. This paper presents {$\lambda$} I{$\leq$}, which is a dependently typed generalization of System F{$\leq$}. The resulting calculus follows the style of Pure Type Systems, and contains a single unified syntactic sort that accounts for expressions, types and kinds. To address the challenges posed by the combination of dependent types and subtyping, {$\lambda$} I{$\leq$} employs a novel technique that unifies typing and subtyping. In {$\lambda$} I{$\leq$} there is only a judgement that is akin to a typed version of subtyping. Both the typing relation, as well as type well-formedness are just special cases of the subtyping relation. The resulting calculus has a rich metatheory and enjoys of several standard and desirable properties, such as subject reduction, transitivity of subtyping, narrowing as well as standard substitution lemmas. All the metatheory of {$\lambda$} I{$\leq$} is mechanically proved in the Coq theorem prover. Furthermore, (and as far as we are aware) {$\lambda$} I{$\leq$} is the first dependently typed calculus that completely subsumes System F{$\leq$}, while preserving various desirable properties.},

Higher-order abstract syntax (HOAS) is a technique for representing higher-order programming language constructs (e.g., {$\lambda$}'s) by higher-order terms at the"meta-level", thereby avoiding some of the bureaucratic headaches of first-order representations (e.g., capture-avoiding substitution). This paper begins with a fresh, judgmental analysis of focusing for intuitionistic logic (with a full suite of propositional connectives), recasting the "derived rules" of focusing as iterated inductive definitions. This leads to a uniform presentation, allowing concise, modular proofs of the identity and cut principles. Then we show how this formulation of focusing induces, through the Curry-Howard isomorphism, a new kind of higher-order encoding of abstract syntax: functions are encoded by maps from patterns to expressions. Dually, values are encoded as patterns together with explicit substitutions. This gives us pattern-matching "for free", and lets us reason about a rich type system with minimal syntactic overhead. We describe how to translate the language and proof of type safety almost directly into Coq using HOAS, and finally, show how the system's modular design pays off in enabling a very simple extension with recursion and recursive types.},

Aims: This paper explores a simple, easy-to-implement method to predict and avoid failures in software systems. The IROP method links elementary source code features to known software failures in a lightweight, easy-to-implement fashion. Method: We sampled the Eclipse data set mapping defects to files in three Eclipse releases. We used logistic regression to associate programmer actions with defects, tested the predictive power of the resulting classifier in terms of precision and recall, and isolated the most defect-prone actions. We also collected initial feedback on possible remedies. Results: In our sample set, IROP correctly predicted up to 74\% of the failure-prone modules, which is on par with the most elaborate predictors available. We isolated a set of four easy-to-remember recommendations, telling programmers precisely what to do to avoid errors. Initial feedback from developers suggests that these recommendations are straightforward to follow in practice. Conclusions: With the abundance of software development data, even the simplest methods can produce "actionable" results.},

But harmoniously integrating these apparently distinct mechanisms\textemdash{}and powerful recent forms of them, including type classes and family polymorphism\textemdash{}in a single language remains an elusive goal. In this paper, we show that a deep unification can be achieved by generalizing the semantics of interfaces and classes. The payoff is a significant increase in expressive power with little increase in programmer-visible complexity. Salient features of the new programming language include retroactive constraint modeling, underpinning both object-oriented programming and generic programming, and module-level inheritance with further-binding, allowing family polymorphism to be deployed at large scale. The resulting mechanism is syntactically light, and the more advanced features are transparent to the novice programmer. We describe the design of a programming language that incorporates this mechanism; using a core calculus, we show that the type system is sound. We demonstrate that this language is highly expressive by illustrating how to use it to implement highly extensible software and by showing that it can not only concisely model state-of-the-art features for code reuse, but also go beyond them.},

  abstract = {Pattern matching is a pervasive and useful feature in functional programming. There have been many attempts to bring similar notions to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in the past. However, a key challenge in OOP is how pattern matching can coexist with the open nature of OOP data structures, while at the same time guaranteeing other desirable properties for pattern matching.  This paper discusses several desirable properties for pattern matching in an OOP context and shows how existing approaches are lacking some of these properties. We argue that the traditional semantics of pattern matching, which is based on the order of patterns and adopted by many approaches, is in conflict with the openness of data structures. Therefore we suggest that a more restricted, top-level pattern matching model, where the order of patterns is irrelevant, is worthwhile considering in an OOP context. To compensate for the absence of ordered patterns we propose a complementary mechanism for case analysis with defaults, which can be used when nested and/or multiple case analysis is needed. To illustrate our points we develop Castor: a meta-programming library inScala that adopts both ideas. Castor generates code that uses type-safe extensible visitors, and largely removes boilerplate code typically associated with visitors. We illustrate the applicability of our approach with a case study modularizing the interpreters in the famous book ''Types and Programming Languages''.},

This paper discusses possible designs for object initialization, and the ``hardhat'' design chosen and implemented in X10 version 2.2. Our implementation includes a fixed-point inter-procedural (intra-class) data-flow analysis that infers, for each method called during initialization, the set of fields that are read, and those that are asynchronously and synchronously assigned. Our codebase of more than 200K lines of code only had 104 annotations. Finally, we formalize the essence of initialization checking with an effect system intended to complement a standard FJ style formalization of the type system for X10. This system is substantially simpler than the masked types of [10], and it is more practical (for X10) than the free-committed types of [12]. This is the first formalization of a type and (flow-sensitive) effect system for safe initialization in the presence of concurrency constructs.},

  abstract = {Effective support for custom proof automation is essential for large scale interactive proof development. However, existing languages for automation via *tactics* either (a) provide no way to specify the behavior of tactics within the base logic of the accompanying theorem prover, or (b) rely on advanced type-theoretic machinery that is not easily integrated into established theorem provers. We present Mtac, a lightweight but powerful extension to Coq that supports dependently-typed tactic programming. Mtac tactics have access to all the features of ordinary Coq programming, as well as a new set of typed tactical primitives. We avoid the need to touch the trusted kernel typechecker of Coq by encapsulating uses of these new tactical primitives in a *monad*, and instrumenting Coq so that it executes monadic tactics during type inference.},

  abstract = {Unification is a core component of every proof assistant or programming language featuring dependent types. In many cases, it must deal with higher-order problems up to conversion. Since unification in such conditions is undecidable, unification algorithms may include several heuristics to solve common problems. However, when the stack of heuristics grows large, the result and complexity of the algorithm can become unpredictable. Our contributions are twofold: (1) We present a full description of a new unification algorithm for the Calculus of Inductive Constructions (the base logic of Coq), including universe polymorphism, canonical structures (the overloading mechanism baked into Coq's unification), and a small set of useful heuristics. (2) We implemented our algorithm, and tested it on several libraries, providing evidence that the selected set of heuristics suffices for large developments.},

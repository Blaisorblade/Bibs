	Abstract = {The development of high-level programming environments is essential if wireless sensor networks are to be accessible to non-experts. In this paper, we present the Regiment system, which consists of a high-level language for spatiotemporal macroprogramming, along with a compiler that translates global programs into node-level code. In Regiment, the programmer views the network as a set of spatially-distributed data streams. The programmer can manipulate sets of these streams that may be defined by topological or geographic relationships between nodes. Regiment provides a rich set of primitives for processing data on individual streams, manipulating regions, performing aggregation over a region, and triggering new computation within the network.

In this paper, we describe the design and implementation of the Regiment language and compiler. We describe the deglobalization process that compiles a network-wide representation of the program into a node-level, event-driven program. Deglobalization maps region operations onto associated spanning trees that establish region membership and permit efficient in-network aggregation. We evaluate Regiment in the context of a complex distributed application involving rapid detection of spatially-distributed events, such as wildfires or chemical plumes. Our results show that Regiment makes it possible to develop complex sensor network applications at a global level.},

	Abstract = {Building high-performance virtual machines is a complex and expensive undertaking; many popular languages still have low-performance implementations. We describe a new approach to virtual machine (VM) construction that amortizes much of the effort in initial construction by allowing new languages to be implemented with modest additional effort. The approach relies on abstract syntax tree (AST) interpretation where a node can rewrite itself to a more specialized or more general node, together with an optimizing compiler that exploits the structure of the interpreter. The compiler uses speculative assumptions and deoptimization in order to produce efficient machine code. Our initial experience suggests that high performance is attainable while preserving a modular and layered architecture, and that new high-performance language implementations can be obtained by writing little more than a stylized interpreter.},

Couldn't they build this system on top of Project Lancet? They need control over optimizations applied to the language interpreter, apply specific ones often...

Understanding questions:
* Fig. 7 -> Fig. 8: why does the sum = 0 node evolve from IWrite to DWrite? Does it evolve on the next method invocation, because the frame variable has become a Double? Where is this explained?
* What's the relation with PyPy? What's the novelty of the Truffle approach?},

	Abstract = {The advent of multi-core and multi-threaded processor architectures highlights the need to address the well-known shortcomings of the ubiquitous lock-based synchronization mechanisms. To this end, transactional memory has been viewed by many as a promising alternative to locking. This paper therefore presents a constructive critique of locking and transactional memory: their strengths, weaknesses, and opportunities for improvement.},

	Abstract = {Software Transactional Memory (STM) is an attractive basis for the development of language features for concurrent programming. However, the semantics of these features can be delicate and problematic. In this paper we explore the tradeoffs between semantic simplicity, the viability of efficient implementation strategies, and the flexibilityof language constructs. Specifically, we develop semantics and type systems for the constructs of the Automatic Mutual Exclusion (AME) programming model; our results apply also to other constructs, such as atomic blocks. With this semantics as a point of reference, we study several implementation strategies. We model STM systems that use in-place update, optimistic concurrency, lazy conflict detection, and roll-back. These strategies are correct only under non-trivial assumptions that we identify and analyze. One important source of errors is that some efficient implementations create dangerous 'zombie' computations where a transaction keeps running after experiencing a conflict; the assumptions confine the effects of these computations.},

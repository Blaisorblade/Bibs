@article{Grust99How,
	Abstract = {Compilers and optimizers for declarative query languages use some form of intermediate language to represent user-level queries. The advent of compositional query languages for orthogonal type systems (e.g., OQL) calls for internal query representations beyond extensions of relational algebra. This work adopts a view of query processing which is greatly influenced by ideas from the functional programming domain. A uniform formal framework is presented which covers all query translation phases, including user-level query language compilation, query optimization, and execution plan generation. We pursue the type-based design---based on initial algebras---of a core functional language which is then developed into an intermediate representation that fits the needs of advanced query processing. Based on the principle of structural recursion we extend the language by monad comprehensions (which provide us with a calculus-style sublanguage that proves to be useful during the optimization of nested queries) and combinators (abstractions of the query operators implemented by the underlying target query engine). Due to its functional nature, the language is susceptible to program transformation techniques that were developed by the functional programming as well as the functional data model communities. We show how database query processing can substantially benefit from these techniques.},

@inproceedings{Abiteboul98,
	Abstract = {Semistructured data is not strictly typed like relational or object-oriented data and may be irregular or incomplete. It often arises in practice, e.g., when heterogeneous data sources are integrated or data is taken from the World Wide Web.  Views over semistructured data can be used to filter the data and to restructure (or provide structure to) it.  To achieve fast query response time, these views are often materialized.  This paper studies incremental maintenance techniques for materialized views over semistructured data.  We use the graph-based data model OEM and the query language Lorel, developed at Stanford, as the framework for our work. We propose a new algorithm that produces a set of queries that compute the changes to the view based upon a change to the source.  We develop an analytic cost model and compare the cost of executing our incremental maintenance algorithm to that of recomputing the view.  We show that for nearly all types of database updates, it is more efficient to apply our incremental maintenance algorithm to the view than to recompute the view from the database, even when there are thousands of such updates.},

Implementing databases. A functional language is used to construct a database manager that allows efficient and concurrent access to shared data. In contrast to the locking mechanism found in conventional databases, the functional database uses data dependency to provide exclusion. Results obtained from a prototype database demonstrate that data dependency permits an unusual degree of concurrency between operations on the data. The prototype database is used to exhibit some problems that seriously restrict concurrency and also to demonstrate the resolution of these problems using a new primitive. The design of a more realistic database is outlined. Some restrictions on the data structures that can be used in a functional database are also uncovered. Manipulating databases.

However, they mostly ignore many hard problems. On list they just support addition at the sides.
Furthermore, they support deletions by extending non-idempotent monoids to groups, but they don't support deletion on idempotent monoids (e.g. sets); for instance they do not have multiplicity counts. They admit this and discuss workarounds or alternative approaches at the end of Sec. 6 of their paper.

Programmers are forced to hand code such queries using nested loops, which is both cumbersome and inefficient. We demonstrate that first-class queries over objects and collections improve program readability, provide good performance and are applicable to a large number of common programming problems. We have developed a prototype extension to Java which tracks all objects in a program using AspectJ and allows first-class queries over them in the program. Our experimental findings indicate that such queries can be significantly faster than common programming idioms and within reach of hand optimised queries.},

	Abstract = {To overcome limitations in the modeling power of existing database systems and provide a better tool for database application programming, Servio Logic Corporation is developing a computer system to support a set-theoretic data model in an object-oriented programming environment. We recount the problems with existing models and database systems. We then show how features of Smalltalk, such such as operational semantics, its type hierarchy, entity identity and the merging of programming and data language, solve many of those problems. Next we consider what Smalltalk lacks as a database system secondary storage management, a declarative semantics, concurrency, past states. To address these shortcomings, we needed a formal data model. We introduce the GemStone data model, and show how it helps to define path expressions, a declarative semantics and object history in the OPAL language. We summarize similar approaches, and give a brief overview of the GemStone system implementation.},

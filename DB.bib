@inproceedings{Henglein2010optimizing,
	Abstract = {We show how to efficiently evaluate generic map-filter-product queries, generalizations of select-project-join (SPJ) queries in relational algebra, based on a combination of two novel techniques: generic discrimination-based joins and lazy (formal) products. Discrimination-based joins are based on the notion of (equivalence) discriminator. A discriminator partitions a list of values according to a user-specified equivalence relation on keys the values are associated with. Equivalence relations can be specified in an expressive embedded language for denoting equivalence relations. We show that discriminators can be constructed generically (by structural recursion on equivalence expressions), purely functionally, and efficiently (worst-case linear time). The array-based basic multiset discrimination algorithm of Cai and Paige (1995) provides a base discriminator that is both asymptotically and practically efficient. In contrast to hashing, discrimination is fully abstract (only depends on which equivalences hold on its inputs), and in contrast to comparison-based sorting, it does not require an ordering relation on its inputs. In particular, it is applicable to references (pointers). Furthermore, it has better asymptotic computational complexity than both sorting and hashing. We represent cross-products and unions lazily (symbolically) as formal products of the argument sets (relations). This allows the selection operation to recognize on the fly whenever it is applied to a cross-product and invoke an efficient equijoin implementation. In particular, queries can still be formulated naively, using filter, map and product without an explicit join operation, yet garner the advantages of efficient join-algorithms during evaluation. The techniques subsume many of the optimization techniques based on relational algebra equalities, without need for a query preprocessing phase. They require no indexes and behave purely functionally. They can be considered a form of symbolic execution of set expressions that automate and encapsulate dynamic program transformation of such expressions and lead to asymptotic performance improvements over naive execution in many cases.},

@article{Lupei2014incremental,
	Abstract = {Incremental view maintenance is an essential tool for speeding up the processing of large, locally changing workloads. Its fundamental challenge is to ensure that changes are propagated from input to output more efficiently than via recomputation. We formalize this requirement for positive nested relational algebra (NRA+) on bags and we propose a transformation deriving deltas for any expression in the language. The main difficulty in maintaining nested queries lies in the inability to express within NRA+ the efficient updating of inner bags, i.e., without completely replacing the tuples that contain them. To address this problem, we first show how to efficiently incrementalize IncNRA+, a large fragment of NRA+ whose deltas never generate inner bag updates. We then provide a semantics-preserving transformation that takes any nested query into a collection of IncNRA+ queries. This constitutes the first static solution for the efficient incremental processing of languages with nested collections. Furthermore, we show that the state-of-the-art technique of recursive IVM, originally developed for positive relational algebra with aggregation, also extends to nested queries. Finally, we generalize our static approach for the efficient incrementalization of NRA+ to a family of simply-typed lambda calculi, given that its primitives are themselves efficiently incrementalizable.},

@techreport{Koch13IQE,
	Abstract = {This article approaches the incremental view maintenance problem from an algebraic perspective. The algebraic structure of a ring of databases is constructed and extended to form a powerful aggregate query calculus. The query calculus inherits the key properties of rings, such as distributivity and the existence of an additive inverse. As a consequence, the calculus has a normal form of polynomials and is closed under a universal difference operator. This difference operator allows to express the so-called delta queries of the incremental view maintenance literature, but also deltas to the deltas (second deltas), deltas to second deltas (third deltas), and so on. The k-th delta of a query of polynomial degree k is purely a function of the update, not of the database. This gives rise to a multi-layered incremental view maintenance scheme in which a view is maintained using a hierarchy of auxiliary materialized views of k-th deltas. What is gained by this hierarchy is that the work required to keep all views fresh given an update is extremely simple.  <p/> The method allows to eliminate expensive query operators such as joins and aggregate sums entirely from programs that perform incremental view maintenance. The main result is that, for non-nested queries, each individual aggregate value can be incrementally maintained using a constant amount of work. This is not possible for nonincremental evaluation and provides a complexity separation between the incremental and nonincremental query evaluation problems.  <p/> As a byproduct, we obtain a query language that is significant in its own right. It is an algebraic language in which queries, like in relational calculus, are built up from base objects (generalized relations) using an extremely small set of connectives -- addition, multiplication, and aggregation. It is based on a family of algebraic structures developed in this article -- called avalanche (semi)rings -- which algebraizes range-restriction. Thus these structures guarantee finite query results in the presence of inequalities, without making use of an explicit selection operation. The entire language behaves like a polynomial ring of relations and thus makes algebraic manipulation very easy. As a simple algebraic language of interesting expressive power -- relational algebra with SQL-style aggregation and unlimited nesting -- it is a natural internal representation language for query processors and compilers.},

	Abstract = {Query processing can be sped up by keeping frequently accessed users' views materialized. However, the need to access base relations in response to queries can be avoided only if the materialized view is adequately maintained. We propose a method in which all database updates to base relations are first filtered to remove from consideration those that cannot possibly affect the view. The conditions given for the detection of updates of this type, called irrelevant updates, are necessary and sufficient and are independent of the database state. For the remaining database updates, a differential algorithm can be applied to re-evaluate the view expression. The algorithm proposed exploits the knowledge provided by both the view definition expression and the database update operations.},

	Abstract = {Existing computational models for processing continuously changing input data are unable to efficiently support iterative queries except in limited special cases. This makes it difficult to perform complex tasks, such as social-graph analysis on changing data at interactive timescales, which would greatly benefit those analyzing the behavior of services like Twitter. In this paper we introduce a new model called differential computation, which extends traditional incremental computation to allow arbitrarily nested iteration, and explain---with reference to a publicly available prototype system called Naiad---how differential computation can be efficiently implemented in the context of a declarative data-parallel dataflow language. The resulting system makes it easy to program previously intractable algorithms such as incrementally updated strongly connected components, and integrate them with data transformation operations to obtain practically relevant insights from real data streams.},

The pure program maintains the result by iterating over the input line by line, starting from an empty input, and doing the full computation (with cost O(n) and significant overhead) at each round. Hence, the overall runtime is quadratic - 12.5 hours on the benchmark input. Their incremental ML implementation takes 1.7 minutes.

Doing the same computation only on the full data takes 31 seconds with Hadoop, 21 with their ML implementation, on a single node.

They report that Hadoop is a batch system with significant overhead. Still, for fairness, instead of single-node Hadoop, they should compare against the non-incremental version of the same code, which would be faster and a more apple-to-apple comparison.},

	Abstract = {Cluster computing systems today impose a trade-off
                 between generality, performance and productivity. Hadoop
                 and Dryad force programmers to write low level programs
                 that are tedious to compose but easy to optimize. Systems
                 like Dryad/LINQ and Spark allow concise modeling of user
                 programs but do not apply relational optimizations. Pig
                 and Hive restrict the language to achieve relational
                 optimizations, making complex programs hard to express
                 without user extensions. However, these extensions are
                 cumbersome to write and disallow program optimizations.
                 We present a distributed batch data processing framework
                 called Jet. Jet uses deep language embedding in Scala,
                 multi-stage programming and explicit side effect tracking
                 to analyze the structure of user programs. The analysis
                 is used to apply projection insertion, which eliminates
                 unused data, as well as code motion and operation fusion
                 to highly optimize the performance critical path of the
                 program. The language embedding and a high-level
                 interface allow Jet programs to be both expressive,
                 resembling regular Scala code, and optimized. Its modular
                 design allows users to extend Jet with modules that
                 produce good performing code. Through a modular code
                 generation scheme, Jet can generate programs for both
                 Spark and Hadoop. Compared with na{\"\i}ve implementations we
                 achieve 143\% speedups on Spark and 126\% on Hadoop.},

	Abstract = {Object-oriented databases (OODBs) provide powerful data abstractions and modeling facilities but they usually lack a suitable framework for query processing and optimization. Even though there is an increasing number of recent proposals on OODB query optimization, only few of them are actually focused on query optimization in the presence of object identity and destructive updates, features often supported by most realistic OODB languages. This paper presents a formal framework for optimizing object-oriented queries in the presence of side effects. These queries may contain object updates at any place and in any form. We present a language extension to the monoid comprehension calculus to express these object-oriented features and we give a formal meaning to these extensions. Our method is based on denotational semantics, which is often used to give a formal meaning to imperative programming languages. The semantics of our language extensions is expressed in terms of our monoid calculus, without the need of any fundamental change to our basic framework. Our method not only maintains referential transparency, which allows us to do meaningful query optimization, but it is also practical for optimizing OODB queries since it allows the same optimization techniques applied to regular queries to be used with minimal changes for OODB queries with updates.},

@article{Litwin92,
	Abstract = {Object-oriented database systems (OODBs) have created a demand for relationally complete, extensible, and declarative object-oriented query languages. Until now, the runtime performance of such languages was far behind that of procedural OO interfaces. One reason is the internal use of a relational engine with magnetic disk resident databases. The authors address the processing of the declarative OO language WS-OSQL, provided by the fully operational prototype OODB called WS-IRIS. A WS-IRIS database is main memory (MM) resident. The system architecture, data structures, and optimization techniques are designed accordingly. WS-OSQL queries are compiled into an OO extension of Datalog called ObjectLog, providing for objects, typing, overloading, and foreign predicates for extensibility. Cost-based optimizations in WS-IRIS using ObjectLog are presented. Performance tests show that WS-IRIS is about as fast as current OODBs with procedural interfaces only and is much faster than known relationally complete systems. These results would not be possible for a traditional disk-based implementation. However, MM residency of a database appears to be only a necessary condition for better performance. An efficient optimization is of crucial importance as well},

	Abstract = {In query optimization, a given query will be transformed by rewrite rules into an equivalent execution plan that is cheaper than the straightforwardly assigned plan according to some cost model. Finding the cheapest of all equivalent execution plans is a challenge since the rewriting of complex queries on the basis of a large set of rewriting rules may potentially span a very large space of equivalent plans. Consequently, one has to either use search strategies to explore (parts of) the search space or some heuristics to prune this space thus making it efficiently traversable. This paper presents the use of search strategies in the CROQUE project. The adaptation of some common strategies led to the development of a simple but powerful heuristics which is demonstrated by examples executed in the CROQUE prototype. The proposed heuristics can support any random-based search strategy or can be used stand-alone. It may be integrated seamlessly into most of the present query optimizers without almost any effort.},

@article{Grust99How,
	Abstract = {Compilers and optimizers for declarative query languages use some form of intermediate language to represent user-level queries. The advent of compositional query languages for orthogonal type systems (e.g., OQL) calls for internal query representations beyond extensions of relational algebra. This work adopts a view of query processing which is greatly influenced by ideas from the functional programming domain. A uniform formal framework is presented which covers all query translation phases, including user-level query language compilation, query optimization, and execution plan generation. We pursue the type-based design---based on initial algebras---of a core functional language which is then developed into an intermediate representation that fits the needs of advanced query processing. Based on the principle of structural recursion we extend the language by monad comprehensions (which provide us with a calculus-style sublanguage that proves to be useful during the optimization of nested queries) and combinators (abstractions of the query operators implemented by the underlying target query engine). Due to its functional nature, the language is susceptible to program transformation techniques that were developed by the functional programming as well as the functional data model communities. We show how database query processing can substantially benefit from these techniques.},

	Abstract = {Semistructured data is not strictly typed like relational or object-oriented data and may be irregular or incomplete. It often arises in practice, e.g., when heterogeneous data sources are integrated or data is taken from the World Wide Web.  Views over semistructured data can be used to filter the data and to restructure (or provide structure to) it.  To achieve fast query response time, these views are often materialized.  This paper studies incremental maintenance techniques for materialized views over semistructured data.  We use the graph-based data model OEM and the query language Lorel, developed at Stanford, as the framework for our work. We propose a new algorithm that produces a set of queries that compute the changes to the view based upon a change to the source.  We develop an analytic cost model and compare the cost of executing our incremental maintenance algorithm to that of recomputing the view.  We show that for nearly all types of database updates, it is more efficient to apply our incremental maintenance algorithm to the view than to recompute the view from the database, even when there are thousands of such updates.},

Implementing databases. A functional language is used to construct a database manager that allows efficient and concurrent access to shared data. In contrast to the locking mechanism found in conventional databases, the functional database uses data dependency to provide exclusion. Results obtained from a prototype database demonstrate that data dependency permits an unusual degree of concurrency between operations on the data. The prototype database is used to exhibit some problems that seriously restrict concurrency and also to demonstrate the resolution of these problems using a new primitive. The design of a more realistic database is outlined. Some restrictions on the data structures that can be used in a functional database are also uncovered. Manipulating databases.

Programmers are forced to hand code such queries using nested loops, which is both cumbersome and inefficient. We demonstrate that first-class queries over objects and collections improve program readability, provide good performance and are applicable to a large number of common programming problems. We have developed a prototype extension to Java which tracks all objects in a program using AspectJ and allows first-class queries over them in the program. Our experimental findings indicate that such queries can be significantly faster than common programming idioms and within reach of hand optimised queries.},

We recount the problems with existing models and database systems. We then show how features of Smalltalk, such such as operational semantics, its type hierarchy, entity identity and the merging of programming and data language, solve many of those problems. Next we consider what Smalltalk lacks as a database system secondary storage management, a declarative semantics, concurrency, past states. To address these shortcomings, we needed a formal data model. We introduce the GemStone data model, and show how it helps to define path expressions, a declarative semantics and object history in the OPAL language. We summarize similar approaches, and give a brief overview of the GemStone system implementation.},

# How I created this repo
I integrate them in other repositories where I need them using [git subtree][Subtree].
I created this repo following [this link][Creation], and I integrate it in other
repos using [these instructions][2]. [This][3] is also relevant.

# Alternatives
These alternatives are the procedure I originally [read on the Internet][Creation].

To fetch updates:

```bash
$ git fetch bibs
$ git subtree merge --squash -P Bibs bibs/master
```

I found the shorter variant through `git subtree`'s manual.

To split and push updates, first fetch updates, and then run:

```bash
$ git subtree split -P Bibs -b bibs-backport
$ git push bibs bibs-backport:master
```

I found the shorter variant through `git subtree`'s manual and experimentation.
The obvious variant failed; it was:

```bash
git subtree push -d -P Bibs bibs bibs-backport:master
```

# Discussion
One important thing is that, unlike I thought, one does not need to pull the
`bibs-backport` branch from `bibs/master`.

To show that, assume that some commits are on `bibs/master` and have been merged
on HEAD but are not on `bibs-backport`: `git subtree` will then extract those
commits and regenerate the same commits, which can then be pushed.

If you instead split updates before fetching existing ones, you get spurious
commits like [Blaisorblade/Bibs@b6c1121d][4], but integrity is still preserved.

	Abstract = {Contexts have been proposed as a means of performing strictness analysis on non-flat domains. Roughly speaking, a context describes how much a sub-expression will be evaluated by the surrounding program. This paper shows how contexts can be represented using the notion of projection from domain theory. This is clearer than the previous explanation of contexts in terms of continuations. In addition, this paper describes finite domains of contexts over the non-flat list domain. This means that recursive context equations can be solved using standard fixpoint techniques, instead of the algebraic manipulation previously used.},

	Abstract = {We apply the categorical properties of polymorphic functions to compile-time analysis, specifically projection-based strictness analysis. First we interpret parameterised types as functors in a suitable category, and show that they preserve monics and epics. Then we define ``strong'' and ``weak'' polymorphism --- the latter admitting certain projections that are not polymorphic in the usual sense. We prove that, under the right conditions, a weakly polymorphic function is characterised by a single instance. It follows that the strictness analysis of one simple instance of a polymorphic function yields results that apply to all. We show how this theory may be applied.
In comparison to earlier polymorphic strictness analysis methods, ours can apply polymorphic information to a particular instance very simply. The categorical approach simplifies our proofs, enabling them to be carried out at a higher level, and making them independent of the precise form of the programming language to be analysed.},

	Abstract = {Partial evaluation of a program p with respect to partial input data s produces a residual program r. If the program r is subsequently run a number of times on values d_i, there is a potential overall gain in efficiency since the static computations are performed only once, namely when the residual program r is generated. In a fully lazy language, a partial function application which is subsequently applied several times yields much of the same sharing. In a lazy language the result of a partial application may be thought of as a "residual graph". This residual graph is not as efficient as a residual program produced by traditional partial evaluators, but simple program transformations can improve the sharing properties of a lazy functional program p to match those obtained by partial evaluation. Since we work in a lazy language and do not generate a residual program we avoid the termination problems suffered by all partial evaluators so far. These results also pave the way for a new class of optimizations of lazy functional programs: namely the binding time transformations employed by users and writers of partial evaluators so far.},

	Abstract = {Lazy functional programming has many benefits that strict functional languages can simulate via lazy data constructors. In recognition, ML, Scheme, and other strict functional languages have supported lazy stream programming with delay and force for several decades. Unfortunately, the manual insertion of delay and force can be tedious and error-prone.
We present a semantics-based refactoring that helps strict programmers manage manual lazy programming. The refactoring uses a static analysis to identify where additional delays and forces might be needed to achieve the desired simplification and performance benefits, once the programmer has added the initial lazy data constructors. The paper presents a correctness argument for the underlying transformations and some preliminary experiences with a prototype tool implementation.},

@incollection{Leung91,
	Abstract = {In this work we describe an innovative strictness analysis method for reasoning about simple and exhaustive demand in higher-order lazy languages. By reasoning about simple demand, we mean determining whether a function requires its input in head normal form whenever its output is so required, i.e., is the function strict? Similarly, by exhaustive demand we mean determining whether a function requires its input in normal form whenever its output is so required, i.e., is the function fully strict?.
Our method, which is based on type inference, supports reasoning about strictness and full-strictness within a unified framework by making essential use of subtypes. In contrast to previous proposals, our method does not require fixpoint iteration and hence should be more amenable to practical use. Furthermore, our method can handle such features as pattern-matching and user-defined datatypes which are important in practical programming. The insight behind our results is that program properties such as strictness can be treated as types possessed by programs. As a consequence, we are able to design an inference algorithm, which given program P constructs a representation for all possible ``strictness'' types deducible for P. This representation takes the form of a set of constraints. We show that strictness and full-strictness properties of P can be derived, in a precise formal sense, from this set of constraints. We include a systematic comparison between our techniques and results and those of higher-order abstract interpretation.},

@article{Launchbury96,
	Abstract = { ABSTRACT The projection-based strictness analysis of Wadler and Hughes is elegant and theoretically satisfying except in one respect: the need for lifting. The domains and functions over which the analysis is performed need to be transformed, leading to a less direct correspondence between analysis and program than might be hoped for. In this paper we shall see that the projection analysis may be reformulated in terms of partial projections, so removing this infelicity. There are additional benefits of the formulation: the two forms of information captured by the projection are distinguished, and the operational significance of the range of the projection fits exactly with the theory of unboxed types. },

By analysing the projections as embedding-projection pairs, we develop an algorithm to translate lazy functions into a strict functional language with explicit closures. The translated functions typically operate on simpler types than the originals, in particular types containing fewer liftings, which correspond to the operational notion of closures. Like the analysis on which it is based, our algorithm is restricted to first-order functions.},

The demand-driven nature of this iteration technique allows us to use large domains including function domains in the style of Burn et al. [BHA86] and Wadler [Wad87] and retain reasonable efficiency.
The implementation, furthermore, allows us to introduce a new way of handling polymorphism by parameterizing the strictness functions with domain-variables.

	Abstract = {The problem of analyzing functional programs requires us to identify subterms of a given term with certain properties. In this paper, we introduce a variant of λ-calculus called labeled λ-calculus to help us build a theory of positional analysis. Labeled λ-calculus uses sets of labels as a means of naming subterms and keeping track of them. We then define a stronger form of strictness called need and show how labeled λ-calculus can be used to compute need. We extend the notion of the need to subterms and use labeled λ-calculus to identify needed subterms. We also use this notion to qualify a function's need for its argument --- to identify how much of the argument to a function is needed to evaluate an application to head normal form.},

They refer to a 1987 paper as "a good survey".

	Abstract = {The original formulation of abstract interpretation represents program properties by sets. A property is understood as the set of semantic values satisfying it. Strongest program properties are defined by the collecting semantics which extends the standard semantics to powersets of semantic values. The approximation relation corresponding to the logical implication of program properties is subset inclusion. This was expressed using set and lattice theory in the context of transition systems. Some applications of abstract interpretation, such as strictness analysis for lazy functional languages, require infinite behaviours of higher-order functions to be taken into account. We solve the problem by returning to the sources of abstract interpretation, which consists in considering collecting semantics. By using Galois connections, properties of the standard semantics naturally transfer to the collecting and then to the abstract semantics. This set-theoretic abstract interpretation framework is formulated in a way which is independent of both the programming language and the method used to specify its semantics. It is illustrated for a higher-order monomorphically typed lazy functional language starting from its standard denotational semantics},

	Abstract = {A new construction of a finite set of strictness properties for any lazy algebraic datatype is presented. The construction is based on the categorical view of the solutions to the recursive domain equations associated with such types as initial algebras. We then show how the initial algebra induction principle can be used to reason about the entailment relation on the chosen collection of properties. We examine the lattice of properties given by our construction for the type nlist of lazy lists of natural numbers and give proof rules which extend the conjunctive strictness logic of [2] to a language including the type nlist.},

@inproceedings{Kuo89,
	Abstract = {In this work we develop a new framework for strictness analysis. We provide a new definition of strictness based on operational semantics which directly addresses the primary aspect of the strictness analysis problem: non-termination of evaluation. Our definition excludes other irrelevant details such as the type system of the language, and imposes minimal constraints on semantic equality of expressions.
We provide a new syntactic representation for strictness properties of programs and a new computational technique for strictness analysis. The syntactic representation takes the form of a simple type language for expressing strictness properties and is much simpler than representations used in previous work. The computational technique is based on well-understood type inference techniques and improves on previous work as it does not require fixpoint iteration.
Our framework is parameterized with respect to the language of strictness properties and type inference techniques. As improvements in computational methods become available, both the language and type inference technique can be naturally extended to more complex and accurate strictness analysis.},

	Abstract = {A property P of a language is said to be definable by abstract interpretation if there is a monotonic map abs from the domain of standard semantics to an abstract domain A of finite height, and a partition of the abstract domain into parts A P and A non-P such that any value has property P if and only if abs maps it to an element of A P. Head-strictness is a property of functions over lists which asserts, roughly speaking, that whenever the function looks at some prefix of a list, it looks at every element in that prefix. We prove that head-strictness is not definable by abstract interpretation.},

@incollection{Jensen91,
	Abstract = {This paper presents a framework for comparing two strictness analysis techniques: Abstract interpretation and non-standard type inference. The comparison is based on the representation of a lattice by its ideals. A formal system for deducing inclusions between ideals of a lattice is presented and proved sound and complete. Viewing the ideals as strictness properties we use the formal system to define a program logic for deducing strictness properties of expressions in a typed lambda calculus. This strictness logic is shown to be sound and complete with respect to the abstract interpretation, which establishes the main result that strictness analysis by type-inference and by abstract interpretation are equally powerful techniques.},
	Annote = {Key result:
"strictness analysis by type-inference and by abstract interpretation are equally powerful techniques".

Practical implication: one shouldn't learn strictness analysis by type-inference to solve problems which abstract interpretation can't solve --- as long as one applies techniques existing by the time of this paper.

But this does not cite Wright91, but Kuo89 (Kuo and Mishra 1989, FPCA); Wright91 cites Kuo89, so it must be a (slight) extension.},
